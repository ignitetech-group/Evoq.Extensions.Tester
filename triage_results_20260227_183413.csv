Evoq.GoogleAnalyticsConnector,Segmentation Rules Management,Configure rule with Any Page option,LEGITIMATE_BUG,HIGH,"The Evoq Google Analytics Connector is confirmed installed with fully implemented Segmentation Rules code, but a naming conflict with the GA4 connector (both using 'GoogleAnalytics' as connector name) causes the legacy connector to be hidden/overridden, making its Advanced Settings and Segmentation Rules features completely inaccessible.","Screenshot shows Connectors page with 'Google Analytics 4' listed but no 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector' visible. Test observations confirm the legacy connector IS installed and has Segmentation Rules implemented, but the GA4 connector's identical internal name causes it to take precedence, hiding the legacy connector's UI and functionality entirely.",Feature UI not accessible - GA4 connector does not have Advanced Settings with Segmentation Rules,1,38.5
Evoq.GoogleAnalyticsConnector,Universal Analytics & GA4 Support,Special characters and XSS input,LEGITIMATE_BUG,HIGH,"The screenshot clearly shows that a script tag XSS payload was accepted and saved in the Measurement ID field without any input validation or sanitization.

Evoq.PersonaBar.AccountSettings,Module UI Loading,Verify HTML template loads without errors,LEGITIMATE_BUG,HIGH,There is a verified 404 error due to RequireJS path misconfiguration - the JavaScript module cannot load because RequireJS is looking for the file at an incorrect path. This is a real configuration bug that prevents the AccountSettings module from functioning.,Screenshots show the Accounts panel fails to open when clicked. The test confirmed the HTML file exists (HTTP 200) but RequireJS returns 404 because it looks for 'scripts/Modules/Evoq.Accounts/Scripts/AccountSettings.js' while the actual path is 'Modules/Evoq.Accounts/scripts/AccountSettings.js'. This path mismatch is a genuine configuration error preventing the module JavaScript from loading.,AccountSettings panel does not open when clicking the Accounts menu icon in PersonaBar | RequireJS path configuration is incorrect - module JavaScript file cannot be loaded | Console error: 404 Not Found for AccountSettings.js at incorrect path,4,44.5

Evoq.PersonaBar.CommunitySettings,Group Home Page Selection,Save group home page selection and verify persistence,LEGITIMATE_BUG,HIGH,The Group Home Page setting shows a clear persistence failure - values are selected and saved (with success notification) but consistently revert to 'Activity' after page navigation or refresh. This is a backend bug where the setting is not properly being persisted or retrieved.,"Screenshots confirm: (1) Discussions was selected and saved, (2) value reverted to Activity after navigation, (3) Wiki was selected and saved, (4) value reverted to Activity again after refresh. The dropdown UI functions correctly but the backend fails to persist the GroupHomePage value.",Group Home Page selection does not persist after saving. The system displays 'Item successfully saved' notification but the value reverts to 'Activity' (default) after navigating away or refreshing the page.

Evoq.PersonaBar.Pages,Page Validation,Validate empty page name,LEGITIMATE_BUG,HIGH,The Name field is marked as required with an asterisk (*) but the system allowed creating a page without a name (Page ID: 63). This is a clear validation failure where client-side and server-side validation are not properly enforcing the required field constraint.,"Screenshot 1 shows the empty Name* field during page creation. Screenshot 3 confirms a page with no name was created and now exists in the page tree (visible as a blank entry with just a page icon below 'Test Page Two'), with Page ID 63 shown in the details panel and the Name field still empty.",Empty page name validation is not working - pages can be created without a name | ValidatePageSettingsData method in PageManagementController.cs checks for empty name but validation is not triggered | Server returns TabExistsException instead of user-friendly validation message,3,40.3
Evoq.Social.ActivityStream,Post Creation and Management,Empty post validation,LEGITIMATE_BUG,HIGH,Screenshot evidence clearly shows an empty post was created and displayed in the activity feed with only the username 'Anonymous' and timestamp 'moments ago' but no content text. This is a validation failure - the system should prevent empty post creation.,"Step 12 shows empty post area with Share button appearing grayed out. Step 13 shows a new post at the top of the feed from 'Anonymous' with timestamp 'moments ago' but completely empty content - only the action links (Like, Comment, Unsubscribe, Remove, Pin) are visible below it, confirming an empty post was successfully created and displayed.",Empty post validation missing - system allows creation of posts with no content. This should be blocked with a validation message.,2,37.9
Evoq.Social.ActivityStream,Post Pinning,Verify pin status across page refresh,LEGITIMATE_BUG,HIGH,The 500 error on the Unpin API call and the pin status not persisting across page refresh indicate a server-side bug - either the database transaction is not committing the pin state or there is a retrieval bug when loading pinned posts.,"Screenshot shows Activity Stream after refresh with all posts displaying 'Pin' links (not 'Unpin'), no blue pin icons visible, and no posts in pinned position. Test observations note a 500 error when calling the Unpin API, indicating a server-side failure in the pin toggle functionality.","Pin status does not persist across page refresh - pinned posts lose their pinned state after browser refresh, indicating either database transaction not committed or retrieval bug",1,36.6
Evoq.Social.Wiki,Article Editing and Updates,Access article detail pages for editing,LEGITIMATE_BUG,HIGH,"The screenshots show actual 404 error pages and empty content areas when attempting to access wiki articles.

Evoq.PersonaBar.CommunityAnalytics,Top Community Users Display,Test avatar display fallback,INVALID_TEST,MEDIUM,"The Top Community Users feature requires actual community engagement data (spectators, active users, power rankings) to display. Without this data present in the test environment, the UI section not rendering is expected behavior, not a bug. The test setup lacked the necessary preconditions.",Test could not find the Top Community Users section because the feature conditionally renders only when community engagement data exists.

Evoq.Social.Wiki,Notifications System,Comment notification system,INVALID_TEST,MEDIUM,"The test was for comment notifications but failed at a prerequisite step (viewing an article to add comments). The notification features that could be tested (privilege notifications, dismiss, subscription toggle) all work correctly. The blank content area shows no error messages and likely represents a missing test precondition rather than a notification system bug.","Screenshot shows empty wiki page with no content but no errors.

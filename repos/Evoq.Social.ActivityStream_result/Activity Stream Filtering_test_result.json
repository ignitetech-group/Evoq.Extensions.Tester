    "The Activity Stream filtering system provides two filtering mechanisms: (1) a quick filter dropdown for single activity type filtering, and (2) a saved custom filters feature for complex multi-criteria filtering.",
    "Custom filters support filtering by: Activity Authors (users), Activity Groups, and Activity Types (journal types).",
    "The suggested test scenario 'Filter by date range' is not available in the UI - code review confirms the FilterBuilder only supports user, group, and journalType filter criteria, not date ranges.",
    "The 'Filter by user' and 'Filter by group' scenarios are implemented through the custom filter creation feature via Activity Authors and Activity Groups fields, rather than as separate standalone filters.",
    "Filter persistence across sessions was not explicitly tested as it requires logout/login cycle, but the saved filters are stored in the database (via SaveFilter/UpdateFilter/DeleteFilter API endpoints) and should persist.",
    "The 'Apply multiple filters' scenario is supported through custom filters which can combine multiple criteria (users, groups, activity types) in a single saved filter."

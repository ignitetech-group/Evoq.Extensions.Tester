  "observations": [
    "The 'Activity Stream Grouping' feature is an automatic backend mechanism, not a user-configurable display option. The feature description mentions 'UI Location: Activity Stream > Display Options' but no such explicit Display Options UI exists.",
    "Grouping occurs automatically when multiple different users perform the same privileged activity (e.g., multiple users earning the same privilege). This displays as 'User X and Y others also earned this privilege'.",
    "The current test data shows activities from a single user (Anonymous/host), so no grouped entries are visible. Grouping requires multiple users performing the same action.",
    "Code analysis confirms the grouping logic is implemented via: CountSimilarEntries parameter in JournalItemsQuery, SimilarCount field in SQL stored procedures, GroupedJournalControl.js for UI interactions, and ActivityStreamParser.cs for rendering grouped entries.",
    "The 'others-grouped-journal' CSS class and GetGroupedJournalBasic/GetGroupedJournalDetailed API endpoints are used to display and expand grouped activities.",
    "Suggested test scenarios like 'Group/Ungroup activities' and 'Expand grouped activities' are not user-controllable actions - grouping happens automatically based on activity data patterns."

    "The localization infrastructure is working correctly - the system loads and displays localized resources. The issue is the absence of Spanish language resource files, not a framework failure.",
    "Code location specified in task (src/Modules/Evoq.PersonaBar.Workflow/admin/personaBar/App_LocalResources/Workflow.resx) could not be verified as the repository was not available locally.",
    "Workflow names and descriptions are user-created content stored in the database, not from resource files - these would need separate localization mechanism for true multi-language support."

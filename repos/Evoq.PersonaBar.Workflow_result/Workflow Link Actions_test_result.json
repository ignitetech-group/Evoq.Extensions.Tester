    "The Workflow Link Actions feature is an internal API-based functionality used in workflow notifications rather than a direct UI feature.",
    "The API endpoint is /API/EvoqContentLibrary/WorkflowsLinks/Index/?id={id}&type={type} where type=1 is for pages (Tab) and type=2 is for files.",
    "For page workflow links (type=Tab), the API sets the user to edit mode and redirects to the page.",
    "For file workflow links (type=File), a Digital Asset Management (DAM) module must be present on the site to redirect to file properties.",
    "The link expiration scenario could not be tested as the feature does not appear to have a time-based expiration mechanism in the code - links remain valid as long as the content exists and the user has permission.",
    "The feature properly implements authentication checks, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page with a return URL for post-login redirect."

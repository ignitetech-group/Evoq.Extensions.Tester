  "observations": [
    "Code review confirms migration functionality exists in ContentLayoutMigrationController.cs, ContentLayoutMigrationRepository.cs, and ContentLayout.cs entity files.",
    "The migration controller provides methods: MigrateContentLayouts(int portalId), IsMigrationApplicable(), and MigrateContentLayout() for individual layouts.",
    "IsMigrationApplicable() checks if the legacy 'ContentLayouts' database table exists before allowing migration.",
    "The migration process: (1) Disables tab versioning/workflow temporarily, (2) Creates new modules from legacy content layouts, (3) Updates pane names, (4) Preserves permissions via InitialModulePermission, (5) Re-enables tab versioning/workflow.",
    "NO UI FOUND: The specified location 'Admin > Site Settings > Migration Tool' does not exist in the Evoq UI. Extensive search was conducted through: Site Settings (all tabs), Manage menu, Settings menu (all options including Import/Export, Extensions, Services, Servers, Scheduler, Config Manager, etc.), and Content Layout module extension settings.",
    "The Content Layout module exists and is installed (version 10.1.1), but its extension settings only show Package Information, Extension Settings (module category, dependencies, etc.), Site Settings (permissions), License, and Release Notes - no migration tool.",
    "CONCLUSION: The Content Layout Migration feature appears to be a backend-only service designed to run programmatically during system upgrades or via API calls, not through a dedicated user interface. All suggested test scenarios (Detect legacy content layouts, Migrate single content layout, Migrate multiple layouts, Handle migration errors, Preserve permissions, Update pane names, Verify tab versioning) cannot be tested via UI as no Migration Tool interface exists.",
    "The migration functionality may be triggered automatically during Evoq version upgrades from 8.x to newer versions, rather than being a manually-accessible tool."

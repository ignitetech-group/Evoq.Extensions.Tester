    "Code review of ContentLayoutMigrationController.cs reveals that Content Layout Migration is implemented as an AUTOMATIC upgrade process, not a UI-driven migration tool.",
    "The migration is triggered through the IUpgradeable.UpgradeModule() interface in BusinessController.cs when the module is upgraded to version 08.02.00.",
    "The migration logic checks if the legacy 'ContentLayouts' database table exists (from Evoq 8.0/8.1) and automatically migrates all content layouts to the new module-based architecture.",
    "Migration process includes: reading legacy layouts, creating new Content Layout module instances, temporarily disabling tab versioning/workflow during migration, updating pane names, and preserving column sizes.",
    "The feature description's UI Location ('Admin > Site Settings > Migration Tool') is incorrect - no such UI element exists.",
    "All suggested test scenarios (Detect legacy content layouts, Migrate single/multiple layouts, Handle migration errors, Preserve module permissions, Update pane names, Verify tab versioning state preservation) cannot be tested via UI as there is no UI component for this feature.",
    "The migration functionality exists in code but is not exposed through any user interface, making it impossible to test via UI interaction as required by the testing philosophy."

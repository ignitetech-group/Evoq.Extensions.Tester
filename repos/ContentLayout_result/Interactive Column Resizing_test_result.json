    "Maximum width is dynamically calculated as: current column width + next column width - minimum width - 1.",

    "The size viewer shows column widths as percentages with a semi-transparent dark background overlay centered in each column.",
    "A publish conflict error occurred during testing ('Another user has taken action on the page') because the resize operation immediately saves via API, changing the page state before the Publish button is clicked. This is expected behavior - the API auto-saves resize changes."

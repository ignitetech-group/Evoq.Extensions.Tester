    "The GA4 connector in the UI is a simple measurement ID-based tracker that does not use OAuth authorization flow",

    "These advanced error handling mechanisms are for a different, API-integrated Google Analytics connector that performs remote authorization",
    "The UI connector implements client-side validation showing user-friendly error messages via toast notifications",
    "Success and error notifications appear as toast messages that auto-dismiss after a few seconds",
    "The Event Log for backend error logging is available through DNN's administrative interface but requires specific navigation"

    "The Azure Compatibility feature is implemented as a declarative flag (<azureCompatible>true</azureCompatible>) in the package manifest file (DNNXE_GoogleAnalyticsConnector.dnn) rather than runtime code logic.",
    "There is no Azure-specific code in the connector source files - the azureCompatible flag simply indicates to DNN that the module is safe to deploy in Azure environments.",
    "True Azure compatibility testing would require deployment to an actual Azure Web Apps environment, which is not available in this localhost:8081 test environment.",
    "The suggested test scenarios (Azure token storage, Azure-specific API calls, Azure security requirements) cannot be meaningfully tested in a non-Azure environment as they only manifest when the application is deployed to Azure infrastructure.",
    "The connector installation and basic functionality (settings UI) work correctly in the localhost environment, which is a prerequisite for Azure compatibility."

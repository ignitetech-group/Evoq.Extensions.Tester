    "CRITICAL: Test environment is localhost:8081, NOT an Azure deployment. Azure-specific test scenarios (connector installation on Azure, token storage in Azure, API calls from Azure, script injection on Azure, performance/scalability on Azure, Azure security requirements) cannot be tested without actual Azure deployment.",
    "Code review confirmed Azure compatibility through: (1) <azureCompatible>true</azureCompatible> declaration in DNNXE_GoogleAnalyticsConnector.dnn manifest at line 20, (2) Settings stored in database via HostController/PortalController (not file system - which is Azure-compatible), (3) Token caching uses Evoq Microservices Framework TokenCachedService designed for cloud environments, (4) No Azure-specific code paths exist - Azure compatibility is achieved through standard DNN/Evoq patterns that inherently support Azure Web Apps.",
    "The connector uses external API endpoint (https://dnnapi.com/analytics) which would work identically from localhost or Azure environments.",
    "On localhost, the connector loads successfully, settings can be viewed/edited, and basic functionality operates - this same behavior would be expected in Azure since the code uses Azure-compatible storage and API patterns."

    "Code review confirmed the connector manifest (DNNXE_GoogleAnalyticsConnector.dnn) includes <azureCompatible>true</azureCompatible> flag on line 20, declaring Azure compatibility.",
    "The connector uses TokenCachedService from Evoq.Microservices.Framework for token storage, which is designed to work with distributed cache systems compatible with Azure environments.",
    "No Azure-specific conditional code paths were found - the connector code is environment-agnostic, relying on the framework's Azure-compatible services.",
    "Azure-specific test scenarios (Azure deployment, Azure token storage, Azure API calls, Azure performance/scalability) cannot be executed in the localhost test environment. These would require actual Azure Web Apps deployment to verify.",
    "The connector's Azure compatibility is primarily ensured through: (1) the azureCompatible manifest flag, (2) use of framework-provided Azure-compatible token caching services, and (3) avoidance of file-system-based session state."

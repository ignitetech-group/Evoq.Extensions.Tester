    "FEATURE IS BACKEND-ONLY WITH NO UI TESTABILITY: The retry mechanism is implemented in GoogleAnalyticsRemoteRetryManager.cs as a backend service wrapper that decorates GoogleAnalyticsRemoteManager operations with Polly retry policies.",
    "CODE ANALYSIS CONFIRMS IMPLEMENTATION: The code shows retry logic using Polly library with: (1) Handling of HttpException for HTTP status codes 408, 500, 502, 503, 504, and 401, (2) Maximum of 3 retry attempts, (3) Logging at Info level for each retry, (4) Token cache clearing on 401 Unauthorized errors via TokenServiceImpl.ClearCache().",
    "NO UI ELEMENTS TO TEST RETRY BEHAVIOR: The Google Analytics 4 connector UI only exposes Measurement ID configuration and Track for Administrators checkbox. There are no UI elements to: configure retry settings, view retry attempts/logs, trigger specific HTTP errors, or observe retry behavior.",
    "TESTING WOULD REQUIRE: To properly test this feature would require either: (1) Unit tests mocking HTTP responses with specific error codes, (2) Integration tests with a mock Google Analytics API that returns controlled errors, or (3) Access to server logs to observe retry behavior during actual API failures.",
    "EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF NOT IMPLEMENTED: Code review reveals the implementation uses simple Retry(3) without exponential backoff timing - the feature description mentions exponential backoff but the actual code does not implement it (uses Polly's basic Retry policy, not WaitAndRetry with exponential delays).",
    "RETRYABLE HTTP STATUS CODES CONFIRMED: RetryPolicyHelper.cs defines the following HTTP status codes as retryable: RequestTimeout (408), InternalServerError (500), BadGateway (502), ServiceUnavailable (503), GatewayTimeout (504), and Unauthorized (401).",
    "Per testing philosophy: A test MUST involve UI interaction and observable verification. Since this feature has no UI exposure, no test scenarios were created. This is documented as an observation rather than a failed test."

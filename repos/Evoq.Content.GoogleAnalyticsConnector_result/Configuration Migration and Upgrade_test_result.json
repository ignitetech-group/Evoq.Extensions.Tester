    "The 'Configuration Migration and Upgrade' feature is described as 'Automatic during module upgrade' - this means it executes automatically during DNN package installation/upgrade process, NOT through any manual UI interaction.",
    "Code review confirmed: No IUpgradeable implementation found in Evoq.Content.GoogleAnalyticsConnector. The upgrade logic would be in the dependent Evoq.GoogleAnalyticsConnector package (version 09.00.00) or handled by the DNN package system.",
    "The Google Analytics connector UI (Settings > Connectors > Google Analytics 4) only shows configuration options: Measurement ID field, Track for Administrators checkbox, Cancel/Save/Delete Connection buttons. No migration-related UI elements exist.",
    "The connector is already labeled 'Google Analytics 4' and uses GA4 measurement ID format (G-XXXXXXXXX), indicating the system has been upgraded to support GA4.",
    "The authorize.js code shows GA4 support with measurementId and dataStreams properties, but this is for normal configuration - not migration.",
    "Per testing instructions: 'Feature exists in code but not visible in UI? Do NOT create a test for it.' - Therefore no test scenarios were created.",
    "Suggested test scenarios (upgrade from UA to GA4, config file migration, custom script templates, backward compatibility, clean install vs upgrade, manifest dependencies) all require triggering the module upgrade process, which cannot be done through UI interaction.",
    "The manifest file (DNNXE_GoogleAnalyticsConnector.dnn) confirms dependencies: DNN Core 07.04.00, Evoq.Library 08.01.00, Evoq.GoogleAnalyticsConnector 09.00.00. These dependencies are checked during package installation, not through UI.",
    "Screenshot evidence captured: Configuration_Migration_and_Upgrade_step01_login_confirmed.png shows successful login and Connectors panel; Configuration_Migration_and_Upgrade_step02_ga4_connector_settings.png shows the Google Analytics 4 connector settings with no migration UI elements."

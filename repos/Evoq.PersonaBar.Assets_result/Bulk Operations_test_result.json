    "CRITICAL FINDING: The 'Bulk Operations' feature does NOT exist in the Evoq.PersonaBar.Assets module.",
    "Code Review Evidence: AssetsController.cs contains only single-item operation endpoints (DeleteFile, DeleteFolder, CopyFile, MoveFile, MoveFolder). No bulk operation API endpoints were found.",
    "Code Review Evidence: Assets.js uses 'selectedItem' (singular) observable, not 'selectedItems'. The viewModel only tracks one selected item at a time.",
    "Code Review Evidence: Search for 'bulk', 'multi-select', 'selectedItems', 'Bulk' patterns returned zero results in the codebase.",
    "UI Verification: No multi-select mode toggle exists in the Assets UI.",
    "UI Verification: No checkboxes appear on file/folder cards for selection.",
    "UI Verification: No bulk action toolbar is present.",
    "UI Verification: Only single-item action icons (edit, move, delete) appear when hovering over an item.",
    "UI Verification: Single-clicking a file triggers immediate download rather than selection.",
    "UI Verification: Right-clicking items does not reveal a context menu with bulk options.",
    "UI Verification: Ctrl+click does not enable multi-selection.",
    "The suggested test scenarios (Select multiple files, Bulk delete files, Bulk move files, Bulk copy files, Bulk permission changes, Operation progress tracking, Handle partial failures, Verify bulk operation permissions) cannot be tested because the feature does not exist.",
    "Recommendation: Either remove 'Bulk Operations' from the feature list for this extension, or implement the feature if it is a planned capability."

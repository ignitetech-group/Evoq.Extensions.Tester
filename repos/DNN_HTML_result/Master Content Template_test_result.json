    "For modules on their native page, the 'Make Master' option is intentionally hidden as they are already on their master page",
    "To test this feature would require: (1) Creating an HTML module on Page A, (2) Sharing/copying it to Page B, (3) Deleting Page A or the module from Page A, (4) Then the 'Make Master' link would appear on Page B",
    "The feature appears designed for recovery scenarios when modules become orphaned from their original master page, not for routine content management",
    "The documented UI location 'Module Actions > Make Master' does not match the actual implementation - the link appears inline within the module content with the message: 'This module does not belong to the page, but its master page is not found. Make this page as master?'"

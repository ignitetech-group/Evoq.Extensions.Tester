Based on code review (HtmlModule.ascx.cs lines 197-216, 278-285), the feature only appears as a warning message link when a shared module is 'orphaned' - meaning the module was added to another page via 'Add Existing Module' and its original master page was deleted. Without an orphaned shared module scenario, the 'Make Master' option cannot be tested via the UI."

    "The warning message 'This module does not belong to the page, but its master page is not found. Make this page as master?' is displayed via ShowMakeMasterMessage() in HtmlModule.ascx.cs",
    "To test this feature properly, one would need to: 1) Create a shared module via 'Add Existing Module', 2) Delete the original master page, 3) Then the Make Master link would appear on the orphaned module",
    "All modules on the current pages are NOT orphaned shared modules, so the Make Master link is not visible in the UI",
    "The feature description 'Module Actions > Make Master' is misleading - it's not a standard module action but a contextual message for error recovery"

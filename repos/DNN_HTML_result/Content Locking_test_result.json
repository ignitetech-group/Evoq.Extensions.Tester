    "A TODO comment in EditHtml.ascx (line 67) reads: '// TODO: Disable edit tab when locked by other user' - indicating the feature was planned but not implemented.",
    "No Lock/Unlock methods exist in HtmlTextController.cs or HtmlTextProController.cs (the main controller files).",
    "The Edit Content page (accessed via /Home/ctl/Edit/mid/{moduleId}) shows only editor options, Custom Editor Options, and Save and Close - no Lock/Unlock functionality.",
    "The 'lock Edit Mode' tooltip in the Persona Bar refers to locking the page editing mode (keeping edit mode active while navigating), NOT content locking to prevent concurrent editing.",
    "Module Actions menu does not contain Lock/Unlock options.",
    "CONCLUSION: The Content Locking feature is specified in resource files but NOT implemented in the DNN_HTML module. No UI-based testing is possible for this feature."

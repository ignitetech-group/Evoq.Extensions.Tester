    "The suggested UI location 'Module Actions > Edit Content > Lock/Unlock' does not exist in the current implementation.",
    "Per testing instructions: Since this feature exists in code planning (resource strings) but has no UI element to test, no test scenarios can be executed. This is documented as an observation rather than a test failure."

    "The VersionController.cs has methods for version management (GetVersion, GetLatestVersion, RollBackVersion) but no explicit comparison method",
    "The UI location specified in documentation (Module Actions > Edit Content > Compare Versions) does not match the actual UI - Edit Content dialog only shows a CKEditor interface without version comparison tabs",
    "Page-level versioning is disabled for the test page ('Versioning: Off'), which may be a prerequisite for accessing content comparison features",
    "This appears to be a case where backend code exists but the UI feature is either not fully implemented, deprecated, or requires specific configuration (versioning/workflow enabled) to be accessible"

    "Code suggests Content Comparison feature exists - HtmlDiff.cs implements a diff algorithm with CSS classes 'diffdel' (deleted), 'diffins' (inserted), and 'diffmod' (modified) for visual highlighting.",
    "VersionController.cs provides version management methods including GetVersion(), GetAllHtmlText(), RollBackVersion(), but no UI endpoint for version comparison was found.",
    "The feature description indicates UI Location 'Module Actions > Edit Content > Compare Versions' but this option was not found in Module Actions menu.",
    "Module Actions > Admin submenu contains: Settings, Export Content, Import Content, Help, Develop, Delete, Refresh - no 'Compare Versions' option exists.",
    "HTML Module Settings tab only has 'Replace Tokens' checkbox and 'Max length of Description in search' field - no version comparison settings.",
    "Page versioning is disabled on test pages (shown as 'Versioning: Off' in Persona Bar), which may be a prerequisite for this feature.",
    "Per testing instructions: Since feature exists in code but no UI element was found to test it, no test scenarios were created."

    "The Content Comparison feature is implemented at the PAGE level through Page History in the Edit Bar, not at the individual HTML module level as suggested by the UI location in the feature description",
    "The comparison uses HtmlDiff.dll to generate visual diffs between page versions",
    "When page state changes during comparison (e.g., from another user action), a conflict dialog appears informing the user to refresh",
    "The visual diff uses CSS styling: insertions are highlighted with green/cyan background, deletions with red/pink background",
    "Synchronized scrolling is implemented between the two version iframes for easy comparison",
    "The feature requires at least two page versions to be available for comparison to work"

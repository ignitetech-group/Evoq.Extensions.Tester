    "CODE ANALYSIS: Localization resources for 'MyWork.Action' still exist in HtmlModule.ascx.resx (lines 143-145, 184-186), indicating the feature was previously implemented but not fully cleaned up",
    "CODE ANALYSIS: The documentation file 'Managing My Workflow Tasks.html' describes the feature as accessing 'My Work' from the HTML Pro module actions menu, but this menu option is not present in the current UI",
    "RECOMMENDATION: The 'My Work Tasks' feature should be removed from the DNN_HTML extension feature list as it is no longer available in the current version. Alternatively, the manifest should be updated to remove the orphaned MyWork control registration."

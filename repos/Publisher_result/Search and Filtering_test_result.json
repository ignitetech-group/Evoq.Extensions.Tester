    "Filter by author: Author filtering is available via URL parameter (author=userId) and works via the Authors sidebar filter, but was not explicitly tested as a separate scenario since it uses the same mechanism as tag filtering.",
    "Search result pagination: The CardViewManager.js implements infinite scroll pagination. Testing would require more than PageSize (default) posts to trigger pagination.",
    "Search result sorting: No explicit sorting controls are visible in the UI. Results appear to be sorted by date (newest first) by default based on code review.",
    "The Search component (Search.ascx.cs) only displays when ViewMode is List and posts exist (NoPosts check).",
    "Multiple tag filtering uses AND logic - posts must have ALL selected tags to appear in results, confirmed in PostManager.SearchPosts method.",
    "FilterManager.cs implements caching for tags and authors using CBO.GetCachedObject with a 1-minute cache duration."

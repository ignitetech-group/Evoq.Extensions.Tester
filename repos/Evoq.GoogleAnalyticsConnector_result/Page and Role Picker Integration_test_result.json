    "Code review confirms the Page and Role Picker Integration feature exists in the Evoq GoogleAnalyticsConnector codebase. The feature is implemented in: connector.js (creates page dropdowns via dnn.DropDownList, handles role selection), advanced.htm (UI template with pagesDropDown and rolesDropDown elements), and ServicesController.cs (GetPagePickerOptions and GetRoles API endpoints).",
    "The Evoq GoogleAnalyticsConnector is deployed at DesktopModules/DNNCorp/Connectors/GoogleAnalytics/ with connector.htm containing the 'advancedSetting' link that opens the Advanced Settings dialog with Page and Role Picker functionality.",
    "However, the Connectors UI only displays 'Google Analytics 4' (from DNN Platform at DesktopModules/Connectors/GoogleAnalytics4/) which uses a simplified template WITHOUT the Advanced Settings link.",
    "The original 'Google Analytics' connector (Evoq) that has the Page and Role Picker feature is NOT visible in the Connectors list. Only 'Google Analytics 4' appears.",
    "Full connector list verified: Amazon S3, Azure Storage, Box, Disqus, Dropbox, Facebook, Google Analytics 4, Google Tag Manager, HubSpot Forms, Kayako, LinkedIn, Mailchimp, Marketo, Optimizely, Twitter, UNC, Zendesk - NO 'Google Analytics' entry.",
    "The GA4 connector template (connector.htm) only has Measurement ID and Track for Administrators fields - no advancedSetting link to access Page/Role Picker.",
    "Per testing philosophy: 'Feature exists in code but not visible in UI? Do NOT create a test for it.' - No test scenarios were created as there is no UI element to access this feature.",
    "Root cause: Two separate Google Analytics connectors exist - the DNN Platform's GA4 connector appears to have replaced or hidden the Evoq Google Analytics connector in the UI, making the Advanced Settings with Page and Role Picker inaccessible."

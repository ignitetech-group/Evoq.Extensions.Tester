    "Code review confirmed that the Segmentation Rules Management feature exists in the Google Analytics connector source code at 'Evoq Content/Connectors/GoogleAnalytics/'. The advanced.htm file contains the UI for managing segmentation rules with fields for Label, Value, Page selection, and Role selection. The connector.js file contains the JavaScript logic for CRUD operations on rules (add, edit, delete, move up/down) with a maximum of 5 rules and 50-character limits on label/value fields.",
    "The connector.htm template file contains an 'advancedSetting' link (line 7) that opens the Advanced Settings dialog with Segmentation Rules. However, this element was NOT found in the deployed UI.",
    "The test environment (localhost:8081) has a different 'Google Analytics 4' connector installed which uses a simplified template (with input ID 'txtGa4ID' vs 'gaTrackingId' in the source code). This connector only provides 'Measurement ID' and 'Track for Administrators' fields without the Advanced Settings link.",
    "DOM inspection confirmed: advancedSettingExists=false, gaBaseExists=false. The deployed connector HTML structure does not match the source code template that includes the Segmentation Rules feature.",
    "The Segmentation Rules Management feature CANNOT be tested because the original Google Analytics connector (with Advanced Settings) is not installed on this test instance. The installed 'Google Analytics 4' connector is a different, simplified connector that does not include this feature.",
    "RECOMMENDATION: To test this feature, the original Google Analytics connector package (DNNPro_GoogleAnalyticsConnector.dnn) needs to be installed on the test environment, or the test environment configuration needs to be updated to deploy the connector that includes the Advanced Settings with Segmentation Rules functionality."

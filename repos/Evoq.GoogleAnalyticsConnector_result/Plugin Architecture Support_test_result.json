    "The original 'Google Analytics' connector (DisplayName: 'Google Analytics') that contains the plugin architecture is NOT visible in the Connectors UI. Only 'Google Analytics 4' connector is shown, which is a separate, simpler connector at DesktopModules/Connectors/GoogleAnalytics4/.",
    "The GetPlugins API endpoint (/API/dnncorp/GoogleAnalyticsConnector/Services/GetPlugins) is still functional and accessible even though the connector UI is not shown.",
    "The deployed instance has an 'authorize.js' plugin in the Scripts folder that was detected by the plugin architecture, though this file does not exist in the source repository (only connector.js exists in Evoq Content/Connectors/GoogleAnalytics/Scripts/).",
    "Plugin initialization via connector.js loadPlugins() function cannot be directly tested via UI since the original Google Analytics connector is not registered in the connectors list. The plugin architecture code exists and the API works, but there is no UI path to trigger the full plugin loading flow.",
    "The suggested test scenarios for 'Initialize plugins with connector context', 'Verify plugin loading order', 'Test plugin error handling', and 'Validate plugin init function call' cannot be tested via UI as they require the connector to be loaded and initialized, which only happens when the original Google Analytics connector panel is opened - and that connector is not present in the UI."

    "The Plugin Architecture Support is an infrastructure/extensibility feature implemented in connector.js (lines 74-90) and ServicesController.cs (lines 63-75).",
    "The GetPlugins API endpoint scans the Scripts folder for .js files, excludes 'connector.js', and returns the remaining files for dynamic loading.",
    "Currently, only connector.js exists in the Scripts folder (Evoq Content/Connectors/GoogleAnalytics/Scripts/), so the plugin list is empty - this is expected behavior.",
    "The plugin initialization code (initializePlugins function) calls the 'init' method on each loaded plugin with the connector context (bindViewModel, helper, rootFolder, utility).",
    "No UI elements exist specifically for plugin management - plugins are automatically loaded when the connector initializes.",
    "The feature is designed for extensibility: developers can add additional .js files to the Scripts folder to extend connector functionality without modifying the core connector code."

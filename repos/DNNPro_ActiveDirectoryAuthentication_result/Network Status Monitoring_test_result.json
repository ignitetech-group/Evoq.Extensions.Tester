    "When no Active Directory environment is available, the feature correctly reports an error with detailed exception information",
    "The feature displays status as a colored message: green for success, red for failure (as seen in the error message styling)",
    "Network status is only checked when the Windows Authentication provider is enabled",
    "Testing with valid AD connection, invalid credentials, and LDAP status reporting could not be performed as no Active Directory environment was available in the test environment. These scenarios require an actual AD infrastructure to test properly.",
    "The error message localization is implemented in the LocalizedStatus() method which translates status labels like '[Global Catalog Status]', '[LDAP Status]', etc."

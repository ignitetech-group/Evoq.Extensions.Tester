    "When AD authentication is disabled, no network status check occurs (expected behavior per code in Settings.ascx.cs lines 166-170)",
    "Error messages are displayed in red banner format, while success messages would appear in green (per code lines 209-216)",
    "Test with valid AD connection and LDAP status verification could not be performed as no Active Directory environment is available in the test environment",
    "Error message localization is implemented in the code (LocalizedStatus method in Settings.ascx.cs) but could not be tested without additional language packs"

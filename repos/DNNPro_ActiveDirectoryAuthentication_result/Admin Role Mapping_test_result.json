    "UserController.cs contains ManageAdminRoleMapping method (lines 212-230) that adds/removes users from Admin role based on AD group membership",
    "The DNNPro_ActiveDirectoryAuthentication extension is visible in Settings > Extensions > Authentication Systems",
    "However, no UI path was found to access the extension's site-specific settings (Settings.ascx) through the modern Persona Bar interface",
    "Clicking the edit icon on the extension row consistently opened the DELETE confirmation dialog instead of the settings panel",
    "The 'Authentication' module (DotNetNuke.Authentication v9.3.2) shows 'In Use: No' and its Site Settings tab only displays permissions, not AD-specific configuration fields",
    "This appears to be a gap in the Persona Bar's ability to expose authentication provider configuration settings",
    "The feature exists in code but cannot be tested via UI as no accessible configuration interface was found"

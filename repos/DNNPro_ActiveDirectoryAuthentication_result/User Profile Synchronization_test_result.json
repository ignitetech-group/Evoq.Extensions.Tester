    "The DNNPro_ActiveDirectoryAuthentication extension (v10.1.1) is installed in the system as confirmed in Settings > Extensions > Authentication Systems",
    "The User Profile Synchronization feature is implemented in code at AuthenticationController.cs:UpdateDNNUser method (lines 344-437)",
    "Code analysis confirms the feature synchronizes the following profile fields from AD to DNN: DisplayName, Email, FirstName, LastName, Profile.FirstName, Profile.LastName, Profile.Street, Profile.City, Profile.Region, Profile.PostalCode, Profile.Country, Profile.Telephone, Profile.Fax, Profile.Cell, Profile.Website",
    "The code includes protection against overwriting with empty values - each field is only updated if the AD value is not empty (e.g., 'if (!(objAuthUser.DisplayName == \"\"))')",
    "The feature is triggered automatically during AD authentication via AuthenticationLogon() and ManualLogon() methods - there is NO dedicated UI element to configure or test this feature directly",
    "The Default Authentication Provider in Security > Authentication settings is set to 'DNN', not Active Directory",
    "Active Directory authentication is not enabled or configured on this site - the AD provider does not appear in the Default Authentication Provider dropdown",
    "UI testing of User Profile Synchronization requires: (1) An Active Directory server configured and running, (2) AD users with populated profile attributes, (3) AD authentication enabled as the default or available provider, (4) Users logging in via AD authentication - none of these prerequisites are available in this test environment",
    "Per testing instructions: 'Feature exists in code but not visible in UI? -> Do NOT create a test for it' - therefore no test scenarios were executed as there is no UI element to interact with for this automatic background feature"

    "The Evoq Assistant Integration is implemented as 'Copilot' - an AI-powered input assistance feature that activates via keyboard shortcuts (Alt+/ on Windows, Ctrl+/ on Mac).",
    "Code review of EvoqPersonaBarContainer.cs confirms 'Evoq.Assistant' is defined as a root menu item (line 45) and the AssistantChat module is loaded when the user has VIEW permission and a valid license (lines 140-145).",
    "The Copilot feature loads from an external AWS S3 bucket (dnn-copilot-react.js) and integrates with form inputs throughout the admin experience.",
    "Console logs show 'active element is not valid' when attempting to activate Copilot on unsupported input types (e.g., search boxes), suggesting Copilot only works on specific form field types.",
    "No dedicated 'Assistant' menu item exists in the PersonaBar sidebar - the integration is embedded directly into form inputs via the Copilot system.",
    "The Copilot welcome dialog shows integration with blog publishing workflows (Tags, Author selection, Publishing options), indicating deep integration with content management features."

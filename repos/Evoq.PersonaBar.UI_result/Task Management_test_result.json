    "Code suggests Task Management feature exists in tasks.js, TasksController.cs, and tasks.html, but the UI is intentionally hidden.",
    "In evoq.js lines 100-102, the code explicitly hides the Tasks panel: '$tasks.hide(); return;' with comment '//hide task bar per CONTENT-8436'.",
    "The Tasks panel would normally appear adjacent to the PersonaBar and display: task list with count, expand/collapse functionality, task details (avatar, sender, time, body), task actions (approve/reject), pagination via 'Load More' button, and auto-refresh every 30 seconds.",
    "The TasksController.cs provides two API endpoints: GetTasks (paginated list) and GetTask (individual task details) that would be called by the hidden UI.",
    "The tasks.html template defines the UI structure including: task title bar with subject, task brief summary, detail view with notification body, action buttons, and navigation footer for grouped tasks.",
    "No UI element found to test this feature as it has been disabled per CONTENT-8436. All suggested test scenarios (view task list, navigate pagination, expand/collapse details, perform actions, mark complete, filter by status, auto-refresh, permissions, 100+ tasks, notification badges) cannot be tested through UI interaction."

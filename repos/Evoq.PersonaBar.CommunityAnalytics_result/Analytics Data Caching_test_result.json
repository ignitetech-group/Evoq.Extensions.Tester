  "observations": [
    "BACKEND SERVICE FEATURE: Analytics Data Caching is explicitly designated as 'UI Location: Backend Service' - there are NO UI elements to test caching behavior directly.",
    "CODE ANALYSIS - Cache Implementation Location: Caching is implemented in AnalyticsController.cs (DotNetNuke.SocialLibrary.Components.Controllers) and AnalyticsTaskHelper.cs (DotNetNuke.Professional.Analytics.Warehouse.Common).",
    "CODE ANALYSIS - Cache Keys: The system defines multiple cache key prefixes for different analytics data types: DashboardStats, SpectatorsChart, ModuleStats, TagStats, PopularContent, TopSpectators, TopActiveUsers, PowerUserRankings, TimeSeriesData, ProblemAreaStats, AverageTimeOnPage, ModulePerformances.",
    "CODE ANALYSIS - Cache Expiration: Standard analytics periods use 1-hour cache expiration (Constants.OneHour). Custom date range queries use 10-minute cache expiration (Constants.TenMinutes).",
    "CODE ANALYSIS - Concurrent Access Handling: The AnalyticsTaskHelper implements thread-safe caching with a dummy object mutex pattern. Concurrent requests wait up to 6 seconds (6 retries x 1000ms) for a previous thread to complete before timing out.",
    "CODE ANALYSIS - Cache Invalidation: Cache entries are automatically removed on exceptions via DataCache.RemoveCache(cacheKey) to prevent stale error states.",
    "CODE ANALYSIS - Cache Storage: Uses DNN's DataCache framework with absolute expiration (DateTime.Now + cacheExpiry), no sliding expiration, and Normal cache priority.",
    "CODE ANALYSIS - Cache Key Generation: Keys are composite strings including portalId, tabId, period, contentItemId, date range, and pagination info for precise cache targeting.",
    "UI VERIFICATION: Navigated to PersonaBar > Dashboard > Community Analytics. The Community Analytics panel menu item exists but the content panel did not display any cache-related configuration or monitoring controls.",
    "CONCLUSION: All suggested test scenarios (cache initialization, expiration, invalidation, concurrent access, hit rates, size limits) are backend/service-level concerns that cannot be tested through UI interaction. Per testing instructions: 'Feature exists in code but not visible in UI - Do NOT create a test for it.'"

  "observations": [
    "Redux state management for user activity is internal implementation - the suggested test scenarios for 'state shape matches expected structure', 'state persistence during tab switches', and 'state cleanup on user change' are code-level concerns that cannot be directly observed through UI interaction. These are implicitly verified by the observable behavior: when activity data loads correctly and updates when switching users, it confirms the Redux actions (RETRIEVED_USER_ACTIVITY_DETAILS) are dispatching properly and the reducer is updating state correctly.",
    "The User Activity panel displays social features (Rank, Reputation, Experience, Engagement, Influence) which are conditionally shown based on the SKU type (DNNSOCIAL). These features were visible in the test environment.",
    "Code review confirmed the reducer handles two action types: RETRIEVED_USER_ACTIVITY_DETAILS for full activity data and RETRIEVED_USER__RECENT_ACTIVITIES for recent activities list updates."

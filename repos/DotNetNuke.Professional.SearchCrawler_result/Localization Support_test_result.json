    "Only English (default) resource files are present - no language-specific resource files (e.g., SharedResources.es-ES.resx) were found in the codebase, which explains the fallback behavior",
    "The language selector in the PersonaBar controls content language context, not necessarily the admin UI language - this is standard DNN behavior"

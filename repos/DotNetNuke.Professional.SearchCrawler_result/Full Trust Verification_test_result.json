    "Full Trust Verification is a backend-only feature implemented in SearchSpiderHelper.cs (DoesApplicationHaveFullTrust method at line 628-631) which calls SecurityPolicy.HasUnManagedCodePermission()",
    "The feature has NO dedicated UI element for displaying trust level - the suggested UI location 'Admin > Host Settings > Security' does not contain a Trust Level display",
    "Full Trust status is only observable through the FileCrawler scheduled task execution logs in Settings > Scheduler > Task History",
    "When Full Trust is NOT available, the code logs 'logFileCrawlerRequiresFullTrust.Text' warning (FileCrawler.cs lines 72-75) - absence of this warning indicates Full Trust IS available",
    "Deep indexing (using iFilter for content extraction) requires Full Trust; the presence of 'Number of files deep indexed: 1' confirms Full Trust is working",
    "Shallow indexing (47 files) serves as fallback for files that cannot be deep indexed, demonstrating graceful degradation is implemented"

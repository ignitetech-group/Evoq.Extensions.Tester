    "Full Trust Verification is an internal runtime check that occurs during File Crawler scheduled task execution, not a dedicated UI setting page.",
    "The feature checks for unmanaged code permission using SecurityPolicy.HasUnManagedCodePermission() method.",
    "When Full Trust is available, deep content indexing extracts file contents for search. When not available, only file names are indexed (shallow indexing).",
    "Code in FileCrawler.cs line 72-75 shows that if Full Trust is NOT available, a warning 'FileCrawler - Warning, filecrawler requires full trust to index files. Only file names will be used for indexing.' would be logged.",
    "The test environment has Full Trust enabled as evidenced by successful deep indexing (5 files deep indexed) and absence of the Full Trust warning message in task history.",
    "The suggested test scenarios 'Handle Medium Trust gracefully', 'Fallback to shallow indexing', and 'Display trust level warnings' cannot be tested in a Full Trust environment without modifying server security policy, which is outside the scope of UI testing."

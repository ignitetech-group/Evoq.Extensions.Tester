    "DirectoryIncludedException is thrown when attempting to add a subdirectory of an already-included parent directory",
    "DirectoryExcludedException is thrown when attempting to add a subdirectory of an already-excluded parent directory",
    "Exceptions are handled at the API level returning HTTP 412 (Precondition Failed) responses with localized error messages, not logged to Event Viewer",
    "The UI location in feature description mentions 'Admin > Event Viewer' but exception handling actually occurs in Search Settings > Crawling tab UI and returns error messages inline",
    "UI testing of exception triggering was limited due to folder picker component interaction challenges, but code review confirms proper implementation"

    "These exception classes are internal to the Search Crawler module and would be logged when specific errors occur during crawling operations",

    "The Event Viewer provides comprehensive exception logging infrastructure with filtering, detail viewing, and configuration capabilities",
    "Exception types available for filtering include: General Exception, Search Indexer Exception, Scheduler Exception, Module Load Exception, Page Load Exception, Security Exception, and many others"

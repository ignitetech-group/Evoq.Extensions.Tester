    "ImageResultController is a simple extension of FileResultController that only overrides the LocalizedSearchTypeName property to return 'ImageSearchTypeName' from the resource file.",
    "Image file type detection is handled in FileCrawlerController.GetSearchTypeId() method which checks if the file extension matches Globals.glbImageFileTypes (jpg, jpeg, gif, png, bmp).",
    "Thumbnail generation was mentioned in the feature description but appears to be handled by the DNN Assets manager rather than directly by the search results display. The search results show the original file names without visible thumbnail previews in the results list.",
    "File Extensions settings under Search Settings only show document types (.doc, .docx, .pdf, etc.) but images are still indexed through the FileCrawlerController's internal image detection logic.",
    "Image permissions are verified through FileResultController.HasViewPermission() which checks FolderPermissionController.CanBrowseFolder or CanViewFolder on the parent folder. Testing with different user roles was not performed as it requires additional user setup."

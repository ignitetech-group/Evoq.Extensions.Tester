  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed UI sorting controls should exist because backend sorting is supported, but the column headers were never designed to be clickable sort controls - they are plain text labels. This is a feature gap expectation, not a broken functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a simple URL list with static column headers (URL, URL TYPE, GENERATED BY) that have no visual affordances for sorting (no arrows, no clickable styling). The UI displays data correctly; it simply does not implement client-side sorting toggles. The test expected functionality that was never part of the UI design.",

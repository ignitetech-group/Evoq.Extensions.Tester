  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because the prerequisite delete action couldn't be performed due to missing moderator permissions (CanModerate=true required for delete button visibility). This is a test setup/precondition issue, not an application bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a functional Wiki article list with no errors. The delete functionality requires CanModerate permissions which the test user didn't have, preventing the prerequisite deletion from being performed. The application is working as designed by restricting delete access to moderators.",

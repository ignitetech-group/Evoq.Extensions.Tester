  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires a 'new installation' to verify default values, but was executed on an existing installation where settings may have been previously modified. This is an incomplete test setup precondition, not a bug in the application.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Profanity Filtering dropdown with 'Filter Content' selected in a functional UI. The test itself acknowledged it 'Cannot definitively test default value without a fresh installation' - the current value simply reflects previously saved settings on this existing installation, not a failure of default value logic.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because the Top Users section wasn't rendered in the UI, but no actual errors occurred. The feature requires specific preconditions (actual community user activity data) to display the rankings, which the test environment likely didn't have - this is an incomplete test setup issue, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Test attempted to compare user metrics between time periods but could not proceed because the Top Community Users section (Top Spectators, Most Active Users, Power Rankings) was not visible. The code analysis confirms the feature is fully implemented with JavaScript components and API endpoints, but the UI component requires populated user activity data to render. No error messages, crashes, or broken functionality were reported - the component simply wasn't displayed, likely due to empty data conditions.",

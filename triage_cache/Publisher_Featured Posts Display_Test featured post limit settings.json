  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because preconditions weren't met (no posts marked as featured), not due to a visible bug. The screenshot shows an image upload dialog, not a Featured checkbox, and there are no error messages or UI failures visible. The tester claims the checkbox 'doesn't persist' but provided no evidence of attempting to save or seeing an error.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows an image upload dialog in the post editor, not a Featured checkbox. The test observes that the Featured section shows 0 posts because no posts are marked featured in the database, but no actual error or save failure is demonstrated.",

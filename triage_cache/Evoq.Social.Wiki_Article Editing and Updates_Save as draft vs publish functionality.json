  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test expected Save Draft functionality in a simplified quick-create article dialog, but Save Draft is likely only available in the full ContentEditor accessed via article detail pages. The 404 errors on article URLs indicate routing configuration issues in the test environment rather than a code bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a minimal 'Create an article' dialog with only Content field and Publish/Cancel buttons. The full ContentEditor.ascx exists with more fields and SaveDraft API endpoints exist in code, but the test couldn't access the full editor because article detail page routing wasn't configured, returning 404 errors.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected a Domain Name field based on legacy code found in advanced.htm, but GA4 connectors use Measurement IDs instead of domain configuration. The test was checking for functionality from Universal Analytics that doesn't apply to GA4.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a working Google Analytics 4 connector with Measurement ID field and Track for Administrators checkbox. No Domain Name field exists in the GA4 UI because GA4 uses a different configuration model than Universal Analytics. No errors or broken functionality visible.",

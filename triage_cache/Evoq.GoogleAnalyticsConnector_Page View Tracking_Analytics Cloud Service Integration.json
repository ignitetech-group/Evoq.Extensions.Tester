  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test used a fake measurement ID (G-TESTID12345) and expected analytics to be enabled, but the application correctly requires actual Google OAuth authorization. The warning message is accurate and expected behavior when real authorization hasn't been completed - this is a test setup limitation, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a functioning Site Analytics page with a warning modal stating 'Analytics is not currently enabled' and prompting to complete Google Analytics Connector setup. The UI correctly reflects that a test measurement ID cannot complete real Google OAuth authorization. The application is behaving as designed by requiring proper Google API authorization before reporting analytics as enabled.",

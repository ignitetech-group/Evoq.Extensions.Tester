  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires the Active Directory Authentication provider to be installed as a precondition, but it was never installed in the test environment. The standard DNN login form is working correctly - there is simply no AD login form because the AD provider was not set up, making this an incomplete test setup rather than a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a standard DNN login page with Username/Password fields, Login/Cancel buttons, and Register/Reset Password options. There is no AD authentication tab or AD-specific login form visible because the AD Authentication Provider was never installed on this site. The test correctly identifies that the code exists in the codebase but the provider is not deployed/enabled.",

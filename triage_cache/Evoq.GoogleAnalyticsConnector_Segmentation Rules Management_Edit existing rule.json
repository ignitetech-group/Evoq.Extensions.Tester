  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking for Segmentation Rules functionality in the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector', but the test environment has the 'Google Analytics 4' connector installed which uses the same connector name and overrides the legacy connector. This is a test environment configuration issue where two competing connectors are installed, not a bug in the edit rule functionality itself.",
  "evidence_summary": "The screenshot shows the Connectors configuration page listing 'GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4' connector but not the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector'. The observations confirm both extensions are installed but share the connector name 'GoogleAnalytics', causing GA4 to take precedence. The Segmentation Rules feature exists in the legacy connector's codebase but is not accessible because the GA4 connector (which has a simpler interface without Advanced Settings) is being displayed instead.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking for draft vs published content separation, but versioning was disabled (Versioning: Off) on the page. Without versioning enabled, there is no draft/published distinction by design - content publishes immediately. This is a missing precondition, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots confirm versioning is explicitly set to Off on the Home page. When versioning is disabled, the system correctly has no distinction between draft and published content. The test expected draft/published separation without first enabling the versioning feature that provides this functionality.",

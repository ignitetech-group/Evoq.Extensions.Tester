  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected an OAuth-based Google Analytics connector to be visible based on legacy code in the repository, but the system has been updated to use a simpler GA4 Measurement ID-based connector instead. The deleted OAuth client confirms this is deprecated functionality, not missing functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a functional Connectors UI with 'Google Analytics 4' connector that expands to reveal a working Measurement ID configuration form. No OAuth UI elements exist because the OAuth approach has been superseded by the simpler GA4 implementation. No errors or broken functionality visible.",

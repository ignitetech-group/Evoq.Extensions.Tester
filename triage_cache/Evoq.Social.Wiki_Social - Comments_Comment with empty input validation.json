  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed due to missing page configuration - no Wiki Article module is placed on the article detail page to display content and comments. This is a test environment setup issue, not a bug in the comments validation feature which exists in the codebase.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a completely empty article detail page with only site header/footer visible. The Wiki module shows articles in list view but article detail pages have no Wiki Article module configured. The comments functionality code exists (PostComment, UpdateComment, etc.) but is inaccessible due to page configuration, not a code defect.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed that because IndexThreads exists in code (ScheduleHistoryItemsSettings.cs), there should be a corresponding UI field. However, this is an internal backend setting stored in the database without admin UI exposure - a common pattern for advanced configuration options. No actual errors or broken functionality were observed.",
  "evidence_summary": "All 5 screenshots show properly functioning UI: Scheduler page loads correctly, task edit dialogs work, Site Settings displays correctly. The only 'issue' is the absence of a thread count UI field, but the test found this setting only through code analysis - there's no indication it was ever intended to have admin UI. The global Max Threads displayed is the scheduler thread pool, not a missing feature.",

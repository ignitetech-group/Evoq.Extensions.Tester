  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed the deprecation warning should display because the code exists in source files, but this is checking implementation details rather than documented user-facing behavior. The connector has been rebranded to 'Google Analytics 4' and the warning may be intentionally disabled or designed for a different UI context.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Google Analytics 4 connector accepting a UA tracking code (UA-123456789-1) and saving successfully with a green checkmark. No deprecation warning is displayed. The UI functions correctly - no errors, crashes, or broken functionality. The test expected a warning based solely on finding warning code in source files.",

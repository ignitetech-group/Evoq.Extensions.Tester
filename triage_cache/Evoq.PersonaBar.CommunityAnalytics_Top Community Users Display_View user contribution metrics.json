  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because the Top Users section wasn't visible, but this is expected behavior when there's no community user data to display. The presence of a 'topCommunity_NoDataAvailable' resource string confirms the feature is designed to handle empty states and may intentionally not render when there's no activity data.",
  "evidence_summary": "No screenshots were provided. Code analysis confirms the Top Community Users feature is implemented with proper API endpoints and resource strings, including an explicit 'NoDataAvailable' state. The test couldn't proceed because the UI component wasn't rendered, which is likely correct behavior for a test environment without actual community engagement data rather than a bug.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires the Active Directory Authentication provider to be installed and enabled as a precondition before checking for its login form. The code existing in the codebase does not mean the provider was configured/enabled on the test site - this is an incomplete test setup issue, not an application bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows standard DNN login form with username/password fields only. The test expected AD authentication tabs but the AD provider was never installed/enabled on this site - a configuration prerequisite that the test failed to establish before attempting to verify the feature.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because the automated tester couldn't complete the prerequisite step of submitting a comment, not because of an actual bug. No errors, crashes, or broken UI elements are visible - the Activity Stream shows normal like/unlike functionality working on posts.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a normally functioning Activity Stream with posts, working Like/Unlike buttons on posts, and Comment links present. The tester was unable to complete comment submission (likely a test automation limitation with form interaction), preventing verification of the comment-specific like feature. No error states or UI issues are visible.",

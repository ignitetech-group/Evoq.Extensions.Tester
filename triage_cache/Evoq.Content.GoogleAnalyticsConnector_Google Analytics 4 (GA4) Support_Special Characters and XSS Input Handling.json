  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test expected client-side input validation on the Measurement ID field that was never indicated in the UI. It flagged a 'potential' XSS vulnerability without demonstrating actual script execution or unsafe rendering - the field simply accepts text input as designed for an admin-only configuration.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show the Google Analytics 4 connector configuration in an admin Connectors panel. The Measurement ID field accepts the script tag text as literal string input. No errors, crashes, or actual XSS execution are shown - the application functions as designed for a freeform text configuration field accessible only to administrators.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The empty article detail pages are due to Wiki module not being configured on child pages - this is a test environment setup/configuration issue, not a code bug. The Revision Management code is fully implemented but the test preconditions (properly configured Wiki module on article pages) were not met.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show pages loading successfully without any error messages, but with empty content areas. The Wiki Test page and article detail pages both render header/footer but no wiki content, indicating the Wiki Article module was never configured on these pages during test setup rather than a functional failure of the revision management feature.",

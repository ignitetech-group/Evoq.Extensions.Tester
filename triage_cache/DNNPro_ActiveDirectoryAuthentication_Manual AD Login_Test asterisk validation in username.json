  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires the Active Directory Authentication provider to be installed and enabled as a precondition. The provider code exists in the codebase but is not installed on the test environment, making this an incomplete test setup rather than a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows standard DNN login form with Username/Password fields and Login button. No AD authentication tab or form is present because the AD provider is not installed. The test cannot validate asterisk rejection when the AD login form doesn't exist in the current environment.",

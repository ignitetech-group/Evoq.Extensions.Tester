{
  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires AD authentication to be enabled and configured as a precondition, but only verified the extension is installed (v10.1.1). Authentication providers must be explicitly enabled by an administrator after installation - having the extension installed does not automatically make it available as a provider option.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show standard DNN authentication settings and login page working correctly. The AD provider simply hasn't been enabled/configured on this site - the extension is installed but not activated as an authentication provider. This is a test setup/precondition issue, not an application bug.",
  "scenario_id": "DNNPro_ActiveDirectoryAuthentication::User Profile Synchronization::Test AD Authentication Provider Availability",

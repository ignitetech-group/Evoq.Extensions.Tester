  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test was designed to validate Segmentation Rules field validation for the legacy Evoq Google Analytics Connector, but the environment displays the Google Analytics 4 connector instead which has no Segmentation Rules feature. This is a test environment precondition issue - the expected connector isn't the active one.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Connectors page with 'GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4' listed, not the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector'. The GA4 connector has a simpler interface without Advanced Settings or Segmentation Rules. Both connectors reportedly share the same internal name 'GoogleAnalytics', causing a conflict where GA4 overrides the legacy connector, making the Segmentation Rules UI inaccessible for testing.",

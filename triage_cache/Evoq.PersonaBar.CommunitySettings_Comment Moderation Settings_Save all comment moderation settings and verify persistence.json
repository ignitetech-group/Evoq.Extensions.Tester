  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The save functionality displays a success message but fails to persist Comment Moderation settings. Screenshots 1-2 confirm checkboxes were enabled and save was clicked. While screenshot 3 doesn't visually capture the checkbox state (cut off), the automated test programmatically verified they were unchecked. A save operation returning success without persisting data is a critical bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows all 5 Comment Moderation checkboxes checked before save. Screenshot 2 shows same state with save operation completed. Screenshot 3 shows page after reload but checkboxes are not visible in viewport - however the test programmatically verified they reverted to unchecked state, indicating settings did not persist despite success feedback.",

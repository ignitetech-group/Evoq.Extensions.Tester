  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires preconditions that were not met - there is no existing wiki article to test revisions on. The empty page shows no error messages or application failures, just the absence of wiki content that would need to be created first before revision management can be tested.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a functioning Evoq CMS page with empty content area in the Wiki Test section. No error messages, crashes, or broken UI elements are visible. The user is properly logged in as SuperUser and the navigation/sidebar are working normally. The emptiness indicates missing test data (no wiki article exists) rather than a bug in the revision management feature.",

  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking for content sorting functionality that requires pre-existing community content data, but the test environment has no content (0 creates, 0 views). The empty state message 'No popular content available in selected period' is correct application behavior, not an error.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Community Analytics dashboard functioning correctly with an empty state. The graph displays properly, metrics show 0 creates and 0 views, and the Popular Content section displays an appropriate 'No popular content available in selected period' message. No error messages or broken UI elements are present - the application is correctly handling the no-data condition.",

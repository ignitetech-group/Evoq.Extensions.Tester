  "reasoning": "The tester confused the standard delete confirmation dialog with an XSS alert. Screenshot 2 clearly shows the script tag displayed as HTML-encoded plain text, and screenshot 3 shows the normal application confirmation dialog, not a JavaScript alert popup.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show proper XSS protection: the script payload is displayed as HTML-encoded text in the state name column (not executed), and the dialog in step 3 is the standard 'Are you sure you want to delete the State?' confirmation with No/Yes buttons - not an alert('XSS') popup.",

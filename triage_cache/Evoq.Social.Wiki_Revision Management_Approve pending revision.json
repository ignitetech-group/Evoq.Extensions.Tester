  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires preconditions that weren't met - to approve a pending revision, an article with pending revisions must first exist. The empty page indicates no articles were created/published before attempting to access revision history, not a bug in the revision approval feature itself.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Wiki page loads successfully with no errors, but content area is empty. This indicates missing test setup (no article created) rather than broken functionality. The revision management code exists and is functional per code review, but the test cannot access it without first creating an article with pending revisions.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires specific preconditions (wiki-related notifications must exist) that were never established. Notification-based deletion cannot be tested without first creating articles and triggering notification-generating events. This is an incomplete test setup rather than a functional bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows an empty wiki page with no errors. Test notes confirm no applicable notifications were found and article detail pages weren't accessible. The NotificationServiceController.DeleteArticle method exists in code but requires the notification workflow to be triggered first - a prerequisite the test did not establish.",

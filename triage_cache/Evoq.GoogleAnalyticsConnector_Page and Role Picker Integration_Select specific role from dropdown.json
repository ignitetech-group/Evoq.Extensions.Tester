  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed the Evoq.GoogleAnalyticsConnector template with Advanced Settings link should be visible, but the application is correctly displaying the GA4 connector UI template. The test was checking for code-level implementation details (advancedSetting CSS class, role selector dropdown) that exist in the codebase but are not exposed in this connector's UI template. No errors, crashes, or broken functionality were observed.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a functional Google Analytics 4 connector panel with Measurement ID field and Track for Administrators checkbox working normally. The simpler GA4 template is rendered rather than the Evoq template with Advanced Settings. Backend APIs for page picker and role selection work correctly. No error messages or UI failures are present - the application functions as designed for this connector type.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because the Top Users section was not rendered in the UI, which is a precondition issue rather than a bug. The feature requires community activity data or specific configuration to display, and the absence of a UI component is not the same as a broken component.",
  "evidence_summary": "Test could not execute because the Top Community Users section was not visible. Code exists for the feature but it requires data (topSpectators, mostActiveUsers, powerRankings) from GetDashboardInfo API to render. No errors or broken functionality were observed - the component simply wasn't displayed, indicating missing preconditions rather than a defect.",

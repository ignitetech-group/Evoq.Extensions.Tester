  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires two separate user accounts to verify notification delivery (one subscriber, one editor), which cannot be accomplished in a single-user testing environment. The code review confirms the notification logic exists and is properly implemented.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a functional Wiki page with working subscription UI ('Subscribe to new Articles' link visible). No errors present. The test failure stems from the inherent limitation that notification delivery between users cannot be verified with only one test account.",

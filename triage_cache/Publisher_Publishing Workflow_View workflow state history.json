  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected a dedicated workflow history UI within the Publisher module, but workflow state history is intentionally handled by DNN core WorkflowEngine, not the Publisher extension. The Publisher module delegates to DNN's workflow system and was never designed to have its own history UI component.",
  "evidence_summary": "Code analysis confirms Publisher uses DNN core WorkflowEngine for workflow tracking. PublishingState tracks CurrentState/PreviousState/NextState for operational purposes, but history viewing is a DNN platform feature accessed via the core Workflows page, not a Publisher-specific UI. No errors or broken functionality - the test simply looked for a feature in the wrong location.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because no users are assigned to the Community Manager role (0 users shown), which is a missing test precondition, not an application bug. The roles page and all UI elements are functioning correctly.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Roles management page working properly, displaying all roles with their user counts. Community Manager role exists but has 0 users assigned. Administrators has 1 user, while Registered Users and Subscribers each have 15. No error messages or broken UI elements are visible - the test simply couldn't proceed due to missing test data (no user with Community Manager role to test with).",

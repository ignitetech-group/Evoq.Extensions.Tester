  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows 0 articles in Wiki module (contradicting the report's claim of 6). Screenshot 2 shows an empty page. Screenshot 3 shows an Assets folder browser panel, not an article detail view. The test couldn't proceed because the required test data (published articles) was not present.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires specific preconditions (AD Authentication provider enabled, Windows Authentication configured, client IP in AutoIP range) that were not met. The test itself acknowledges the provider is not enabled - this is a test environment setup issue, not an application bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a normal, functional login page with no errors. The test observations confirm module files are deployed correctly and WindowsSignin.aspx is properly configured in IIS. The failure is explicitly attributed to the AD Authentication provider not being enabled and configured, which is a prerequisite for SSO functionality.",

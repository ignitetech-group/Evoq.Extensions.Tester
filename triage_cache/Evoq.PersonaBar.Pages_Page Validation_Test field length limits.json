  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test expected field length validation that was never implemented in the application. Code review confirmed no length validation exists in the codebase - this is a missing feature, not a broken one. The page creation worked correctly; the system simply lacks this particular validation by design.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a 300+ character page name being entered and successfully saved. The page was created without errors and displays on the front-end. No validation errors, crashes, or unexpected behavior occurred - the application functioned as designed, just without length restrictions on page names.",

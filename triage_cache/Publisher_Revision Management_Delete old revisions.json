  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed backend revision deletion methods (DeleteLastPendingToBePublishedRevision, HardDelete) should have a user-facing UI, but these appear to be internal workflow functions for managing revisions programmatically during the publishing process, not features intended for end-user access. No errors, crashes, or broken functionality were observed.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a standard post editor with image upload area and toolbar icons. No revision history UI is visible, but there are also no error messages or broken elements. The backend methods found (DeleteLastPendingToBePublishedRevision, HardDelete) have naming that suggests internal workflow automation rather than user-facing deletion features.",

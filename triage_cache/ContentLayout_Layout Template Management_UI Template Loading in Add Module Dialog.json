  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The Content Layout panel opens completely empty when it should auto-load available templates. The second screenshot proves the UI rendering works correctly when templates are manually populated, confirming the bug is in the JavaScript initialization/event binding that should trigger the GetContentLayoutTemplates API call.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows the Content Layout panel opened with a completely blank/empty area where templates should be listed. Screenshot 2 shows the same panel with templates properly displayed (25%+75%, 75%+25%, 25%+50%+25%, 33%+33%+33% layouts) after manual JavaScript population, proving the rendering code works but the automatic initialization is failing.",

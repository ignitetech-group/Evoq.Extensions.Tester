  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking implementation details (DOM attributes like data-name and textContent, resource file key mappings) rather than user-facing behavior. The PersonaBar displays icons, not text labels, so no user would see 'nav_Accounts' displayed. This is an internal code-level check, not a UI bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a standard Evoq PersonaBar with icon-based menu items on the left side. No visible text showing 'nav_Accounts' to users. The test was inspecting DOM attributes and comparing manifest resourceKey values against .resx file entries - these are implementation details not visible to end users.",
  "scenario_id": "Evoq.PersonaBar.AccountSettings::PersonaBar Menu Integration::Test menu item localization displays 'Accounts'",

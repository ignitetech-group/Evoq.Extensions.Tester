  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was attempting to verify user mention notifications but was blocked by article page rendering issues. The test observations confirm that the Wiki notification system IS functional for other notification types, and code review confirms UserMentionNotificationsController exists. The screenshot shows an empty content area without any error messages - this is a test setup/prerequisite failure, not a bug in the notification feature itself.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a Wiki page with completely empty content area (no article content rendered), but no error messages, crashes, or UI failures. The navigation, sidebar, and header all function normally. The test couldn't verify mention notifications because it couldn't create/view article content, not because the notification system failed.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because no groups exist in the test environment to test group context subscription. This is a missing precondition/test setup issue, not a bug - the Groups page UI is functioning correctly and displaying '0 Groups' / 'No groups were found' as expected when no groups exist.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Groups page working correctly with proper UI elements (search, filter, create group buttons), displaying 'No groups were found' and '0 Groups'. No error messages or broken functionality visible. The test simply couldn't proceed because the required test data (groups with Wiki modules) was never set up.",

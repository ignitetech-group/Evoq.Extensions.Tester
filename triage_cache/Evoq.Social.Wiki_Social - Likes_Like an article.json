{
  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failure is due to incomplete environment setup - article detail pages were not configured with the Wiki module to display article content and social actions. The Like functionality exists in the code but requires proper page configuration with the Wiki Article control, which is a test setup/configuration issue, not a code bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show Wiki module works correctly on Wiki Test page in edit mode with articles visible, but navigating to article detail URLs leads to empty pages because those destination pages lack the Wiki module configuration. No error messages or broken functionality visible - just missing module configuration on article detail pages.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed a 'Revision History' UI should exist because backend code (RevisionManager.cs, RevisionController.cs) implements revision tracking functionality. However, the revision system is an internal/backend-only feature - revisions are tracked automatically but there is no user-facing UI to view them. The absence of UI is not an error; the feature was never exposed to end users.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show normal Publisher module operation: successful login, post creation and publishing work correctly, and edit mode functions properly. No error messages, crashes, or broken functionality. The test searched for a 'Post Editor > Revision History' UI element that simply does not exist in the product - the revision tracking is purely internal backend functionality with no user-facing interface implemented.",

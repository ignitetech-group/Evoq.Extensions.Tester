  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed bulk delete functionality should exist, but this feature was never implemented in the Assets extension. The code review confirms only single-item endpoints exist (DeleteFile, DeleteFolder), and the UI correctly shows single-item hover actions. There is no bug - the test looked for non-existent functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Assets panel with single-item hover menu containing Edit/Move/Copy/Download/Delete icons. No multi-select checkboxes, bulk operations toolbar, or 'Select All' controls are present. UI functions correctly for single-item operations with no errors visible.",

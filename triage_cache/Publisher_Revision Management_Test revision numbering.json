  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed revision numbering should be visible in the UI because backend code contains a Sequence property in the Revision entity. This is checking implementation details rather than documented user-facing behavior - the revision system operates internally without a user-facing revision history panel.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a standard post editor with image upload and text formatting tools. No revision history UI, revision numbers, or sequence display exists in the visible interface. The editor functions normally with no errors. The test found backend revision tracking code but no corresponding UI, which doesn't constitute a bug since many internal systems don't expose all data to users.",

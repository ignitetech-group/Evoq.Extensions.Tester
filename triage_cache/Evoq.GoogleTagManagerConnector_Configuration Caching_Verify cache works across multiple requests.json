  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking implementation details (GTM script presence in page source and code review of caching logic) rather than user-facing behavior. Configuration Caching is a backend optimization with no dedicated UI, and the screenshot shows admin interface rather than frontend pages where script injection occurs.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Evoq Pages admin panel with Home page details - a normal admin interface with no errors. The test attempted to verify backend caching behavior by checking for script injection, but this is an internal implementation detail not visible to users. The 'bug' was identified through code review of TagManagerModule.cs, not observable UI failures.",

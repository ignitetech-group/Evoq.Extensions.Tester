  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test looked for 'Preview as different user role' functionality in the HTML module's Content Preview UI, but this is a platform-level user impersonation feature, not a capability that belongs to a content editing module. The HTML module provides content preview (how content looks when published), not page-level role impersonation.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Evoq CMS page with HTML module displaying AV Products content. The VIEW SITE dropdown and edit toolbar are visible, but these provide page preview modes (Preview, Tablet, Phone), not user role impersonation. No error or malfunction is present - the test simply expected a feature that doesn't exist in this module because it's architecturally a platform-level concern.",

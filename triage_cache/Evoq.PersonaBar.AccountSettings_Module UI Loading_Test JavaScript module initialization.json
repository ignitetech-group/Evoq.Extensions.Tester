  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking JavaScript implementation details (init function execution) on a placeholder/stub module that intentionally has empty init/load functions. Testing internal JavaScript execution on a placeholder module is checking implementation details rather than user-facing behavior.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows PersonaBar Settings menu with no visible errors. Test observations confirm the module is a 'placeholder/stub with minimal functionality' containing empty init/load functions and 'Hello World' text. The module files exist and are accessible, and the menu item appears correctly - the test was simply verifying internal JavaScript details on a non-functional placeholder.",

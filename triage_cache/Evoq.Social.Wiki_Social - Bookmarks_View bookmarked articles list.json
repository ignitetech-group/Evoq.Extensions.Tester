  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed a dedicated 'View Bookmarked Articles' UI should exist within the Wiki module, but the bookmark feature is designed for individual article actions (bookmark/unbookmark buttons) with viewing bookmarked content accessed through user profile or activity feed integration, not as a standalone Wiki module feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a fully functional Wiki articles list page with multiple test articles, create/search functionality, and no errors. The UI displays normally with articles like 'Test Article for Tagging', 'Test Article for Search', 'Test Article for Bookmarks', etc. Code confirms bookmark/unbookmark API methods exist and work on individual articles, but there was never a dedicated 'My Bookmarks' list view designed for the Wiki module itself - the test was looking for functionality in the wrong location.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because the Wiki Article detail view module was not configured on article subpages - this is a page template/module placement configuration issue in the test environment, not a code bug. The code review confirms Report functionality is fully implemented.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 2 shows Wiki module works correctly on the list page with 4 articles. Screenshot 3 shows the article detail page renders with header/footer but completely empty content area - no Wiki module placed there. No errors visible, just missing module configuration.",

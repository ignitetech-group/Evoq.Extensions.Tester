  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected tag autocomplete functionality that was never implemented in the Wiki module. Code review confirms dnnTagsInput is initialized without an autocomplete source parameter - this is a missing feature by design, not a bug in existing functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a normal 'Create an article' dialog with Tags field containing 'tes'. No autocomplete dropdown appears, but no errors occur either. The application works correctly - it simply doesn't have autocomplete for tags because that feature was never built (confirmed by code showing dnnTagsInput initialized without autocomplete source).",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking implementation details (resource file key names vs manifest resourceKey attributes) rather than actual user-facing behavior. The screenshots provided do not show any raw 'nav_Accounts' text being displayed - they show a functioning Workflows panel with no visible localization issues.",
  "evidence_summary": "Both screenshots show the same Workflows panel with properly localized UI text. No evidence of the claimed 'nav_Accounts' raw key displaying anywhere. The test appears to have inspected code/config files and assumed a mismatch would cause visible problems, but no user-facing bug is demonstrated in the visual evidence.",

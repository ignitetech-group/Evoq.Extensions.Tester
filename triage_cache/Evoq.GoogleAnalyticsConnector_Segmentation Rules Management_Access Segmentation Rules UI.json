  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The 'Evoq Content Google Analytics Connector' with Segmentation Rules is installed (confirmed in Extensions list), but the Connectors UI only shows 'Google Analytics 4' connector. Both connectors are installed but GA4 takes over the Google Analytics slot in the UI, making the Segmentation Rules feature completely inaccessible to users despite being properly installed.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show: (1) Successful login; (2) Connectors page displays only GA4 with simple Measurement ID form - no Advanced Settings link; (3-4) Extensions > Connectors confirms 'Evoq Content Google Analytics Connector' is installed at v10.1.1; (5) Full Connectors list shows GA4 with just 'Connect' button, no separate legacy Google Analytics connector entry visible. The installed legacy connector's Segmentation Rules feature cannot be reached from any UI path.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test failure is self-attributed to 'knockout.js binding issues where the validation does not recognize values entered via automated typing.' This is an automation interaction problem, not a real user-facing bug - manual user typing properly triggers knockout.js bindings and validation.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show the form was visibly filled with valid data (Title='Markdown Test Article', Article Type='Concepts', Content with wiki links, Tags as chips). The dialog remained open after Publish, but no validation errors are visible in screenshot 4. The test's own observation identifies this as an automation/knockout.js binding compatibility issue rather than an application defect.",

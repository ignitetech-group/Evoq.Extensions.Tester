  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test could not be executed because the required preconditions were not met - test user credentials were unknown and no users were assigned to the security roles needed for role-based testing. This is an incomplete test setup, not a bug in the application.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a properly functioning Roles page with Community Manager, Content Editors, and Content Managers roles all having 0 users assigned. Code review confirmed role-based access control is correctly implemented. The test failure was due to inability to login as a test user and lack of users in security roles for testing.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was designed for the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector' which includes Segmentation Rules, but the environment has 'Google Analytics 4' connector active instead. GA4 is a separate connector with a simpler feature set that intentionally does not include Segmentation Rules - this is by design, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Connectors page listing 'Google Analytics 4' connector rather than the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector'. Both connectors use the same 'GoogleAnalytics' name causing GA4 to take precedence. The GA4 connector has a minimal interface (Measurement ID and Track for Administrators only) and does not include Advanced Settings with Segmentation Rules - this is expected behavior for GA4, not a defect.",

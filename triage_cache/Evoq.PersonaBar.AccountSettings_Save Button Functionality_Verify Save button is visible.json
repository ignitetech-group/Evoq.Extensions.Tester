  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test is checking for a Save button that the code explicitly defines as a non-functional placeholder with no event handlers. The AccountSettings extension is a stub/template that was never fully implemented - the test assumed functionality should exist because code files exist, but the extension was never intended to be functional in its current state.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows successful login with Assets panel open. Screenshot 2 shows clicking Accounts menu did not open any panel. Code review confirms the Save button is a placeholder anchor tag with no onclick/href, and the JS module contains only empty stub functions - this is unimplemented scaffold code, not a broken feature.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "Both Publish and Discard operations fail with identical 'Another user has taken action' errors, indicating corrupted test environment state rather than a bug in the Discard feature specifically. The auto-save feature (every 5 seconds) combined with rapid test actions created a self-inflicted state conflict.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows the discard confirmation dialog working correctly. Screenshot 2 shows an error dialog stating 'Another user has taken action on the page and its state has been changed.' The test observations confirm page state management issues in the test environment affecting multiple operations identically.",

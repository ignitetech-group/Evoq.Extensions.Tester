  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking implementation details (which JavaScript library is injected) rather than user-facing behavior. Using gtag.js for UA tracking IDs is the modern recommended approach by Google and works correctly - there is no functional bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a functional Google Analytics 4 connector UI with no errors. The test expected UA codes to use analytics.js specifically, but gtag.js handles both UA and GA4 tracking IDs correctly. This is an implementation preference check, not a functional failure.",

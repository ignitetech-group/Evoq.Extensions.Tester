  "reasoning": "Screenshot evidence clearly shows an empty post was created and displayed in the activity feed with only the username 'Anonymous' and timestamp 'moments ago' but no content text. This is a validation failure - the system should prevent empty post creation.",
  "evidence_summary": "Step 12 shows empty post area with Share button appearing grayed out. Step 13 shows a new post at the top of the feed from 'Anonymous' with timestamp 'moments ago' but completely empty content - only the action links (Like, Comment, Unsubscribe, Remove, Pin) are visible below it, confirming an empty post was successfully created and displayed.",

  "reasoning": "The 30-second auto-refresh feature was intentionally disabled per ticket CONTENT-8436. The code exists but is deliberately not executed because the task panel UI is hidden by design. Testing a feature that was purposefully turned off is not a valid test.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows normal Site Analytics page with Google Analytics connection prompt - no errors visible. The test observations confirm the code exists but is intentionally disabled via '$tasks.hide(); return;' per ticket CONTENT-8436. The test was checking for functionality that was deliberately disabled by a product decision.",

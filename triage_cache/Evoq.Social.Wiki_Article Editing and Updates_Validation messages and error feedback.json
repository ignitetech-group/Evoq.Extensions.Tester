  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The 404 error is due to article detail page URL routing not being configured in the test environment, which is a test setup/configuration issue rather than a bug in the wiki module code. The code review confirms validators and content editor functionality exist properly.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a standard 404 error page stating 'Sorry, the page you are looking for cannot be found.' The test observations confirm this is because 'Article detail page URL routing is not configured' - the wiki module requires routing configuration that was not set up before testing. The underlying validation code (validateArticleTitle, validateArticleType, validateArticleTag) exists in the codebase but cannot be tested due to missing environment setup.",

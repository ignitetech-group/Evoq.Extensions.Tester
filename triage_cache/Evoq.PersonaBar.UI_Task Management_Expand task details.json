  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The Tasks UI is intentionally hidden per internal ticket CONTENT-8436, with code explicitly calling '$tasks.hide(); return;' in evoq.js. This is a deliberate product decision, not a bug - the test attempted to verify functionality that was purposely disabled.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows PersonaBar with Site Settings panel open but no Tasks UI visible. The test confirms the Tasks panel is hidden via code (evoq.js lines 100-102) per ticket CONTENT-8436. The backend API works fine, but the UI was intentionally disabled, making this an invalid test scenario for hidden functionality.",

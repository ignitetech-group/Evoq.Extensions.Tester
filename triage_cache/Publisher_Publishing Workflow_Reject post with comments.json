  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test never reached the actual reject functionality. The screenshot shows the Scheduler panel (an unrelated Site Settings feature), not the Publishing Workflow reject UI. The tester got blocked by navigation issues and couldn't execute the intended test.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot displays the Scheduler panel showing scheduled tasks (Content Personalization Data Migration, Purge Log Buffer, Messaging Dispatch) with no evidence of the Publishing Workflow reject feature being accessed or tested. No error messages or broken functionality visible - the test simply failed to navigate to the correct location.",

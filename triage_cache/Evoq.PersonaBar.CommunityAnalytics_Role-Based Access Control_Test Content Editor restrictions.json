  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test could not be executed because the required precondition (users assigned to Content Editor role) was not met. This is a test setup issue, not a bug - the roles exist and the UI displays them correctly, but no users are assigned to enable role-specific testing.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Roles management page with all roles (Content Editors, Community Manager, Content Managers) displaying 0 users. The UI is working correctly with no errors visible. The application is functioning as expected - it simply has no test users configured in the necessary roles to verify role-based access restrictions.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed the AccountSettingsController should have HTTP endpoints just because the controller class exists in code. However, the controller is an intentionally empty placeholder/stub with no action methods defined - this is by design, not a bug. The 404 is expected behavior when no endpoints are implemented.",
  "evidence_summary": "The screenshot shows a standard IIS 404 error for /API/PersonaBar/AccountSettings. The test documentation confirms the controller inherits correctly from PersonaBarApiController but has an empty class body with no action methods. The PersonaBar menu config also shows empty controller/path fields, indicating functionality is handled elsewhere or not yet needed.",

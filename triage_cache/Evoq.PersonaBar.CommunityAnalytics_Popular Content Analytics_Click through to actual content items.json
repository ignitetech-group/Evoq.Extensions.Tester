  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test could not be executed because the test environment lacks community content data, which is a missing precondition for testing click-through functionality. The UI correctly displays 'No popular content available in selected period' - this is proper empty state handling, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Community Analytics dashboard functioning correctly with an empty state message for Popular Content. The chart shows zero creates/views, and the UI appropriately indicates no content is available. There are no error messages, broken UI elements, or application failures - the feature simply cannot be tested without content data in the environment.",

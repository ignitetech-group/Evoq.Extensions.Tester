  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test looked for 'blog author activity monitoring' functionality that was never implemented in the product. The Blogs Module Analytics dashboard is designed for content-level aggregate metrics (blog view rates, comment rates, engagement trends), not individual author statistics. No error or broken functionality exists - the UI is working as designed.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a functioning Blogs analytics dashboard with aggregate content metrics (blogs older than 6 hours with no views, blogs older than 24 hours without comments, blogs with deleted comments) and an engagement timeline chart. No author-specific analytics section exists, and the dashboard operates correctly for its intended purpose of content-level analytics.",

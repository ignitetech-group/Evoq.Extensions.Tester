  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The error shown is a legitimate concurrency protection mechanism, not a bug. The test observations confirm 'Direct Publish workflow correctly returns without action when discard is attempted (by design)' - the test created a workflow state conflict through its own actions and blamed the application.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows 'Another user has taken action on the page' error dialog when attempting discard. This is standard workflow state conflict handling. The test documentation itself notes that Direct Publish workflow correctly returns without action for discard operations by design, indicating the test triggered expected behavior, not a bug.",

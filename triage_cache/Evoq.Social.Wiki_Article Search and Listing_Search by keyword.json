  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires specific preconditions that weren't met - newly created Wiki articles must be indexed by DNN's scheduled search task before appearing in keyword search results. The search module is functioning correctly by redirecting to site-wide search with Wiki type filter; the 'no results' is expected behavior for unindexed content.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows Wiki module with search interface in edit mode. Screenshot 2 shows global Search Results page with 'type: Wiki' filter and 'technology' keyword returning 'No results found' - no error messages or application failures visible, just unindexed content not appearing in search as expected.",

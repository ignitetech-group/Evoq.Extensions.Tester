  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected a UI element for workflow propagation that was never designed to exist. The code-level functionality (PropagateWorkflowToChildren) is triggered programmatically, not via a dedicated UI element. The test incorrectly assumed that backend code should have a corresponding UI.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows the Our Products page with child pages, Versioning and Workflow both Off. Screenshot 2 shows the Advanced > More tab containing only Security and Cache Settings - no workflow propagation UI exists here by design. The UI is functioning correctly; the test was looking for functionality that is only available programmatically.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected input validation to block script tags, but the application uses output encoding for XSS prevention instead. Screenshot 2 clearly shows the script tag is HTML-encoded (&LT;SCRIPT&GT; not <script>), which is a valid and equally effective security approach.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows script tag entered as page name. Screenshot 2 shows the page was created BUT the script tag is properly HTML-encoded in the navigation bar as &LT;SCRIPT&GT;ALERT(&#39;XSS&#39;)&LT;/SCRIPT&GT;, meaning XSS is actually being prevented through output encoding rather than input validation.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test required specific preconditions (a real, published GTM container ID) that weren't available. The validation mechanism is working correctly by rejecting invalid/unpublished containers - this is expected behavior, not a bug. The test was unable to provide valid test data.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the GTM connector configuration UI functioning normally with a container ID entered. The test tried arbitrary/guessed container IDs that are not actually published on Google's servers. The validation correctly rejected them by checking against Google's live endpoint. This is a test setup/data issue, not an application bug.",

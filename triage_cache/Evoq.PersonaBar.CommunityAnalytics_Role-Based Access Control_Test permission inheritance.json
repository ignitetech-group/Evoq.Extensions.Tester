  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failure is due to missing test preconditions (no users assigned to Administrator or other security roles to test with), not an application bug. The application functions correctly for the SuperUser who could access it.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Community Analytics dashboard working correctly with SuperUser access. No errors visible. The test was unable to verify permission inheritance because no regular Administrator users were available for testing due to credential issues and empty role assignments - a test setup problem, not an application defect.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was designed to test Segmentation Rules in the legacy Evoq Google Analytics Connector, but the GA4 connector (which lacks this feature by design) is the active connector. This is a test precondition issue - the feature doesn't exist in GA4, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Connectors page with 'GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4' listed but no legacy connector visible. GA4 connector has a simpler interface without Advanced Settings or Segmentation Rules. The test assumed Segmentation Rules would be accessible, but that feature only exists in the legacy connector which is overridden by GA4 due to shared connector naming.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test found delete functionality in the API code (WorkflowsController.cs) and assumed it should be exposed in the UI, but workflow deletion may be intentionally an admin/API-only operation not meant for the standard UI. The UI shows no indication that delete should be available - there's no broken or missing button, just an API feature not exposed in the interface.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows workflow editing panel with workflow states table. The ACTIONS column contains edit/delete buttons for individual workflow STATES (Draft, Published) but not for the workflow itself. No error messages, crashes, or broken UI elements are visible. The test assumed API functionality should have UI representation.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The empty article detail page indicates missing test preconditions - no Wiki articles were created before attempting to test revision deletion. The page renders without errors, but simply has no Wiki content to interact with, suggesting incomplete test setup rather than a functional bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a successfully rendered Evoq CMS page with WIKI TEST menu visible, but the content area is completely empty with no Wiki module content, no articles, and no error messages. The test expected to find an article with History link for revision management, but no Wiki content exists on the page.",

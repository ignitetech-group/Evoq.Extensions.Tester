  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The article detail page is empty because no Wiki Article module has been configured on that page to display article content and comments - this is a CMS page configuration issue in the test environment, not a bug in the comments functionality which exists and works as confirmed by code review.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a completely empty Wiki Test page with only a trial version warning banner. There are no error messages, crashes, or broken UI elements - just a blank content area because the Wiki Article module needed to display article content and comments was never added to the page template during test environment setup.",

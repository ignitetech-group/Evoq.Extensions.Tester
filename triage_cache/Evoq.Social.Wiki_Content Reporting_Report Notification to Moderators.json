  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The Report functionality code is fully implemented but the test environment's article detail page template lacks the Wiki Article module placement, making the Report UI inaccessible. This is a test environment configuration issue, not a code bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows completely empty article detail page with no Wiki modules rendered. No error messages or crashes visible - the page simply has no content modules configured. Code review confirmed the Report feature is fully implemented in Article.ascx, ReportContent.ascx, and ReportController.cs.",

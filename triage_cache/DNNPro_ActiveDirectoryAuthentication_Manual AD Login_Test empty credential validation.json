  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires the Active Directory Authentication provider to be installed as a precondition, but it was not installed in the test environment. This is an incomplete test setup issue, not a bug in the application.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a standard DNN login form without any AD authentication tab or AD-specific fields. The test correctly identified that the AD provider is not installed, which means the test scenario cannot be executed - the empty credential validation test is valid but the environment lacks the required precondition (AD provider installation).",

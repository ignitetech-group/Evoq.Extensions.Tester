  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was looking for a 'File Type Filtering' feature with 'Filter Options' UI that does not exist in the product. The code review confirms no such functionality is implemented - this is not a missing/broken feature, but a test specification for functionality that was never built.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a fully functional Assets interface with Sort dropdown (Last Modified/Date Uploaded/Alphabetical) and Search box, but no 'Filter Options' UI exists anywhere. The application is working correctly; the tested feature simply does not exist in this product.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected a MyWork control that no longer exists in the codebase (MyWork.ascx was not found). The observations indicate this feature was deprecated and workflow management was consolidated into Content Library. There are no actual errors - the page loads normally, just without the legacy control.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows successful workflow configuration to Content Approval. Screenshot 2 shows a normally-loading page with empty content area when accessing the legacy MyWork URL - no error messages, 500 errors, or application failures visible. The test was looking for deprecated functionality that has been replaced by Content Library workflow management.",

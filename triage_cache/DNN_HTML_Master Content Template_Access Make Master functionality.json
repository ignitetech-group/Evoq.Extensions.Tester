  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The 'Make Master' feature is a conditional UI element that only appears for orphaned shared modules (when the original master page is deleted). The test expected this to be a standard menu item, but it's designed to only appear under specific circumstances. The test failed because the necessary preconditions (creating a shared module via 'Add Existing Module' then deleting its master page) were not established.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a functioning CMS with working edit mode, module actions menus, and settings dialogs. No errors, crashes, or broken functionality visible. The 'Make Master' option is absent because none of the modules are orphaned shared modules - this is expected behavior, not a bug. The test was checking for UI that only conditionally appears and requires specific setup that was not performed.",

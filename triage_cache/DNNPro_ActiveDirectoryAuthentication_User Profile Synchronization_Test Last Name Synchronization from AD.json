  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires Active Directory/Windows Authentication infrastructure that is not configured in the test environment. The HTTP 401.2 error is an IIS configuration issue (Windows Authentication not enabled in IIS), not a bug in the extension itself. The extension code for last name synchronization exists and is correctly implemented.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows IIS HTTP Error 401.2 - Unauthorized when attempting to access WindowsSignin.aspx. The error indicates 'No authentication protocol (including anonymous) is selected in IIS' and Windows Authentication is not configured on the server. The test observations confirm the extension is installed (v10.1.1) with correct profile synchronization code including LastName field, but AD authentication provider is not enabled - this is a test environment infrastructure gap, not an application bug.",

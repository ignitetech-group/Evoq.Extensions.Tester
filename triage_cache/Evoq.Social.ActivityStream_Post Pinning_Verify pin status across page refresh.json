  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The 500 error on the Unpin API call and the pin status not persisting across page refresh indicate a server-side bug - either the database transaction is not committing the pin state or there is a retrieval bug when loading pinned posts.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Activity Stream after refresh with all posts displaying 'Pin' links (not 'Unpin'), no blue pin icons visible, and no posts in pinned position. Test observations note a 500 error when calling the Unpin API, indicating a server-side failure in the pin toggle functionality.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The error shown is intentional conflict detection behavior (DnnTabVersionException) designed to prevent concurrent editing issues. The test created its own problem by accumulating page changes during the test run, then blamed the application when the safety mechanism correctly detected the state mismatch.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows the discard confirmation dialog working correctly. Screenshot 2 shows a conflict detection error that the test documentation confirms is intentional safety behavior from DNN's versioning system. The test's own prior actions changed the page state, triggering the expected concurrency protection mechanism.",

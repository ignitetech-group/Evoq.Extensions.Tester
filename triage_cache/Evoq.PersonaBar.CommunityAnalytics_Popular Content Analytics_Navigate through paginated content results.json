  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires popular content data to exist in order to test pagination controls, but the test environment has no community content. This is a test setup/precondition issue, not a bug - the application correctly displays 'No popular content available in selected period' when there is no data.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Community Analytics dashboard with 'Creates & Views' chart displaying all zeros, and the Popular Content section showing 'No popular content available in selected period'. The UI is functioning correctly by displaying an appropriate empty state. Pagination controls are implemented in code (confirmed at social-dashboard-instance.js:990) but only appear when there are more than 5 items to paginate.",

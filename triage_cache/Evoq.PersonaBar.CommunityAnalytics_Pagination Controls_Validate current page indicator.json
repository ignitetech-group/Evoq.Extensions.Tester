  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test looked for page number indicators that don't exist in this implementation - code review confirms pagination uses prev/next arrow navigation only, not numbered page indicators. Additionally, pagination controls are correctly hidden due to no data (empty test environment), which is proper behavior not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Community Analytics page with zero data - 'Creates & Views' chart is empty, 'Trending Tags' shows 'No trending tags available in selected period', 'Popular Content' shows 'No popular content available in selected period'. No pagination controls are visible because the pagerVisible binding correctly hides them when totalResults === 0. No errors present in UI.",

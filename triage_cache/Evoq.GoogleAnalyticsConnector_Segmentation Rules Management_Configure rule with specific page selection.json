{
  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test requires the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector' to be active, but the test environment has both the legacy and GA4 connectors installed with the same connector name, causing GA4 to override the legacy connector. This is a test environment configuration conflict, not a bug in the Segmentation Rules feature itself.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Connectors settings page displaying 'GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4' connector instead of the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector'. The Segmentation Rules feature exists in the legacy connector's code but is inaccessible because the GA4 connector (which lacks this feature) is taking precedence due to both extensions using the same 'GoogleAnalytics' connector identifier.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed the Top Community Users section would be visible in the UI based on code analysis showing the feature exists in JavaScript. However, the component not rendering is not an error - it indicates the feature either requires specific configuration/preconditions to display, or the section intentionally hides itself when there's no data rather than showing an empty state message.",
  "evidence_summary": "The test could not find the Top Users section in the UI at all. Code analysis confirmed the feature exists in JavaScript files with resource strings, but the actual UI did not render the component. No error messages, crashes, or application failures occurred - the section simply was not present, suggesting configuration/environmental preconditions were not met or the component hides itself entirely when no data is available.",

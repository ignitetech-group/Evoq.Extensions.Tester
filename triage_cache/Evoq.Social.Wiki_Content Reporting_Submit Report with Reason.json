  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The Content Reporting feature is confirmed fully implemented via code review. The test failure occurs because the test site's article detail pages don't have the Wiki module configured on them - this is a page template/module placement configuration issue in the test environment, not an application code bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows an empty article detail page with no Wiki module rendered. The Wiki listing page works correctly, but navigating to article detail URLs shows no content because the Wiki Article detail module was never placed on the page template. The Report link cannot be accessed because the entire Wiki module that contains it is missing from the page layout.",

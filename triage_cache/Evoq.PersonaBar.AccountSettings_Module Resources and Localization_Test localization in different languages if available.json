  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking implementation details (existence of language-specific resource files and resource key naming conventions) rather than user-facing behavior. The screenshot shows the UI functioning normally with proper English text displayed - no raw resource keys are visible.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a working Users management page with all UI elements displaying proper English labels (Users, NAME, EMAIL, JOINED, etc.). No errors, raw resource keys, or localization failures are visible. The test was examining internal resource file structure rather than actual user experience.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test failed to find the settings form but did not exhaust all navigation options. The screenshot shows an edit/pencil icon next to the extension that was not clicked, and DNN authentication provider settings are often configured through legacy admin pages rather than Persona Bar, which the test did not attempt.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Extensions panel with DNNPro_ActiveDirectoryAuthentication installed with visible edit icons. Test claimed settings were inaccessible but did not attempt clicking the edit icon on the extension or accessing legacy admin authentication pages. No actual errors or broken functionality visible - just incomplete test navigation.",

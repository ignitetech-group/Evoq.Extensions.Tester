  "reasoning": "The screenshot clearly shows a 404 error page when navigating to a wiki article detail page. This is a genuine URL routing failure - clicking on an article link should display the article content, not a 404 error page.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Evoq CMS 404 error page with message 'Sorry, the page you are looking for cannot be found and might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.' The WIKI TEST menu item is visible in the navigation, confirming the Wiki module exists, but article detail page routing is broken.",

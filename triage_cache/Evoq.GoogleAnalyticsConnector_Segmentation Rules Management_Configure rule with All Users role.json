  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test attempted to access Segmentation Rules functionality that belongs to the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector', but the system has the 'Google Analytics 4' connector active instead, which is a different product with a simpler feature set that intentionally does not include Segmentation Rules. This is a test setup/precondition issue, not an application bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "The screenshot shows the Connectors page listing 'GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4' as the available Google Analytics connector. The test observations confirm that while the legacy Evoq Google Analytics Connector extension is installed, the GA4 connector appears in the UI instead due to both using the same connector name. The GA4 connector has a simplified interface without Advanced Settings/Segmentation Rules by design, so the test was looking for functionality that doesn't exist in the active connector.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test was for comment notifications but failed at a prerequisite step (viewing an article to add comments). The notification features that could be tested (privilege notifications, dismiss, subscription toggle) all work correctly. The blank content area shows no error messages and likely represents a missing test precondition rather than a notification system bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows empty wiki page with no content but no errors. Test notes confirm notification system works for multiple functions (privilege notifications, dismiss, subscription toggle). The failure occurred because the test couldn't navigate to article content to add comments - a test setup/precondition issue rather than a notification feature defect.",

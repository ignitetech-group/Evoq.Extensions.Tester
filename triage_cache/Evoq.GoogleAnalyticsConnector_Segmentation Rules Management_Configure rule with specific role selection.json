  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was looking for Segmentation Rules functionality that belongs to the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector', but the active connector in the system is 'Google Analytics 4' - a different product that by design does not include Segmentation Rules or Advanced Settings. The test incorrectly assumed legacy connector features would be available in the GA4 connector.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Connectors page with 'GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4' listed (not the legacy connector). GA4 is a simpler connector without Advanced Settings or Segmentation Rules. The test was attempting to access a feature that only exists in the legacy connector's codebase but is not part of the GA4 product.",

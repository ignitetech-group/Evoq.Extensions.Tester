  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected a tag cloud visualization feature in the Wiki module, but code review confirms tag cloud functionality was only ever implemented in the Blogs module (SettingCloudSkin constant). The Wiki module has working tag functionality (filtering, display) but was never designed to include a tag cloud feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "The screenshot shows the Wiki module with functional tagging: a 'Filter by tag' input field successfully filtering articles, tags displayed on articles (testtag, documentation, test@tag#1), and a test article properly tagged. The existing tag functionality works correctly - the test simply looked for a tag cloud feature that doesn't exist in this module and was never intended to.",

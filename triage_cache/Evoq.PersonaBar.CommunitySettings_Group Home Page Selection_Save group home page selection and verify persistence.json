  "reasoning": "The Group Home Page setting shows a clear persistence failure - values are selected and saved (with success notification) but consistently revert to 'Activity' after page navigation or refresh. This is a backend bug where the setting is not properly being persisted or retrieved.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots confirm: (1) Discussions was selected and saved, (2) value reverted to Activity after navigation, (3) Wiki was selected and saved, (4) value reverted to Activity again after refresh. The dropdown UI functions correctly but the backend fails to persist the GroupHomePage value.",

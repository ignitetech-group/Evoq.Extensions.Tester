  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires specific infrastructure preconditions (a Windows-authenticated resource) that weren't available in the test environment. This is not a bug but an incomplete test setup - the code shows proper error handling exists, but runtime behavior simply cannot be verified without appropriate test infrastructure.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a normal CMS product page with no errors. The test acknowledges it 'Cannot fully test authentication failure handling without a Windows-authenticated resource to crawl against' and confirms via code review that error handling is implemented in DocumentWorker.cs with try-catch blocks and exception logging.",

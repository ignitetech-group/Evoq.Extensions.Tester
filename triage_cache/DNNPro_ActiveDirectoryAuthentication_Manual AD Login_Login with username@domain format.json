  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires AD authentication provider to be installed and configured, but the test environment only has the standard DNN login form. This is a missing precondition/incomplete test setup, not a bug in the application.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows standard DNN login page with Username/Password fields and Login button. No AD authentication tab or AD-specific login form is visible. The page is functioning normally - the AD authentication provider simply isn't installed on this test environment.",

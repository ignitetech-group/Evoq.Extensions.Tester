  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires IIS Windows Authentication to be enabled and an Active Directory server to be connected - these are infrastructure preconditions that weren't met in the test environment, not bugs in the application. The 401.2 error is expected behavior when Windows Authentication is not configured.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows IIS HTTP 401.2 Unauthorized error when accessing WindowsSignIn.aspx, with error code 0x80070005 indicating no authentication protocol is selected in IIS. This is a server configuration issue preventing the test from running, not a bug in the AD Authentication extension which the test observations confirm is properly implemented.",

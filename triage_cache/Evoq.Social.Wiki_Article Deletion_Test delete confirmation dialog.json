  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The wiki page content area renders completely empty when it should display article content. The tester navigated to what should be an article detail page but no content is rendered at all, preventing access to the Delete button and any other article functionality. This is abnormal behavior - a wiki page should either show article content or indicate no articles exist.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Evoq Wiki Test page with a completely empty content area - no article content, no controls, nothing displayed in the main section except the trial version notice. The user is logged in as SuperUser Account with full permissions, but the wiki article detail page fails to render any content, making the Delete button (and all article functionality) inaccessible.",

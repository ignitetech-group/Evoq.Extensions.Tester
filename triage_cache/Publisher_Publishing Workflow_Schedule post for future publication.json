  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed a 'Schedule post for future publication' feature should exist, but code review explicitly confirms this functionality was never implemented in the Publisher module. The controller has no Schedule method and no scheduling UI exists - this is a missing feature, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Code review shows PublishingPostController.cs has Submit, SaveDraft, Publish, Reject, Discard but no Schedule method. PublishingManager.cs defines only three workflow types (Direct Publish, Save Draft, Content Approval) with no scheduling capability. No errors were encountered - the test simply looked for functionality that doesn't exist in this module.",

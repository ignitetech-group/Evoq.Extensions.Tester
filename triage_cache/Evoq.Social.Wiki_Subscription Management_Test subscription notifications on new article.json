  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test explicitly acknowledges it cannot verify notification delivery because notifications go to other subscribers, requiring a multi-user test environment that wasn't available. The subscription UI works correctly and the notification code exists - this is a test setup limitation, not an application bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows working Wiki module with successful subscription status ('Unsubscribe from Articles' visible). The test acknowledges the notification code exists in Notifications.cs but cannot verify actual delivery because notifications are sent to other users, requiring a second account to confirm receipt. No errors or broken functionality visible.",

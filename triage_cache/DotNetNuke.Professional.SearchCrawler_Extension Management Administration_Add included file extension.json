  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires a specific precondition that was not met - the host whitelist must include the extensions being added. The validation error is the system working correctly by enforcing host-level security restrictions, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show the File Extensions UI loads correctly, the add form appears properly, and validation displays appropriate error indicators (red border + error icon) when entering extensions not in the host whitelist. The validation is intentional security behavior, and existing extensions were pre-configured when the whitelist was set up by host administrators.",

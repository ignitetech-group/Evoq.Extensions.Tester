  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected a specific UI implementation (toggle switch with On/Off labels from advanced.htm) that exists in the codebase but is not used by the current Google Analytics 4 connector. The actual UI uses a functional checkbox for 'Track for Administrators' which achieves the same functionality with a different UI style - this is a design choice, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "The screenshot shows the GA4 connector interface with a working 'Track for Administrators:' checkbox and 'Measurement ID' field with Save/Cancel buttons. The test failed because it expected a toggle switch UI component that was found in code files (advanced.htm) but the production UI intentionally uses a simpler checkbox design. There are no errors visible - the admin tracking feature is functional, just implemented differently than one code file suggested.",

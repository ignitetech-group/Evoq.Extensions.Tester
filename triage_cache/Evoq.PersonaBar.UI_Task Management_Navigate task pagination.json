  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The Tasks UI is intentionally hidden per ticket CONTENT-8436 (code explicitly calls '$tasks.hide(); return;' in evoq.js lines 100-102). This is not a bug but a deliberate business decision to disable the feature. The test is attempting to verify pagination for a UI that was purposely hidden.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the PersonaBar Settings panel with no Tasks UI visible anywhere. The test documentation confirms the Tasks panel was intentionally hidden via code change tied to ticket CONTENT-8436. The backend API still works but the frontend UI element is deliberately suppressed, making pagination testing impossible by design rather than due to any defect.",

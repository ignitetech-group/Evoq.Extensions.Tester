  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires Wiki Article and Wiki MetaData modules to be configured on the article detail page, but the page was never set up with these modules. This is a test environment setup issue (missing preconditions), not a product bug - the wiki metadata functionality exists and works, it just wasn't deployed to this test page.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a completely empty article page with only a trial warning banner. No Wiki modules are present on the page because they were never configured there. The code review confirms the metadata functionality exists in MetaDataController.cs, MetaDataEditor.ascx, and MetaDataControl.ascx - the modules simply need to be added to the page to test them.",

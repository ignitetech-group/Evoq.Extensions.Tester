  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed drag-and-drop should exist in Templates because JavaScript code exists, but the CSS intentionally hides drag handles in the templates-list view by design. The drag functionality was implemented for the pages hierarchy list view, not the template thumbnail grid view.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a functional Templates page with grid/thumbnail view displaying template cards. No drag handles are visible because the CSS rule '.templates-list ul li div.page-item span { display: none; }' intentionally hides them. The test incorrectly assumed backend code presence means UI functionality should exist, but this is a design choice not a bug.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed Advanced Settings UI should exist because code files (advanced.htm, connector.js) were found in the codebase. However, the Google Analytics 4 connector is a simplified modern implementation that only requires Measurement ID configuration. The legacy advanced settings code (Domain Name, toggle switches) appears to be for the deprecated Universal Analytics, not GA4. The test was checking implementation details in code rather than documented GA4 user-facing functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a functional Google Analytics 4 connector UI with Measurement ID field and Track for Administrators checkbox - the standard GA4 configuration. No errors, no broken elements, no Advanced Settings link. The test found legacy code files and incorrectly assumed they should be exposed in the current GA4 connector UI.",

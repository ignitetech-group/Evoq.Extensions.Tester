  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected autocomplete functionality that was never implemented in the tags input field. This is a feature enhancement request, not a bug - the application is working as designed without auto-suggest capability.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows tags input accepting text 'tech' with existing tags displayed as chips, but no autocomplete dropdown. The test observations confirm auto-suggest is not implemented and the GetTopTags API is only used for filter display, not input autocomplete.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires the AD authentication provider to be installed and enabled as a precondition. The screenshot shows only a standard DNN login form with no AD tab, confirming the provider is not configured on this test environment - this is a test setup/precondition issue, not a bug in the application.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows standard DNN login page with Username and Password fields, Login/Cancel buttons, Remember Login checkbox, and Register/Reset Password options. No Active Directory login tab or form is visible, confirming the AD authentication provider is not installed or enabled on this test instance. The application itself is functioning correctly.",

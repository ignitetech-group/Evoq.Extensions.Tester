  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failure is due to incomplete test environment configuration - the Wiki article detail pages have no Wiki Article module configured to display content and comments. The Wiki list module works correctly; the article detail page template simply was never set up with the necessary modules.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show the Wiki module lists articles correctly in edit mode, but article detail pages are completely empty in both view and edit modes with no pane placeholders, indicating the page template lacks any module configuration. This is a test setup/configuration issue, not an application bug - there are no error messages or broken functionality.",

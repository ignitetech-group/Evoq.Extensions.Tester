  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test attempted to edit content using JavaScript DOM manipulation and contentEditable changes rather than the actual editor UI controls. The inline editing mask is intentional design behavior, not a bug, and the test's programmatic approach bypassed the proper editing workflow.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows edit mode opened successfully with no errors. Screenshot 2 shows the post displaying correctly in view mode with no corruption or errors. The failure was caused by the test using JavaScript manipulation to edit content rather than the actual editor interface, and the inline editing mask blocking programmatic clicks is by design.",

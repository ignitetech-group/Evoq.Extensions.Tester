  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires Active Directory infrastructure not present in the test environment, and the test assumed provider-specific settings should be accessible through the Persona Bar's Security section. The Settings.ascx control for AD authentication is a legacy module settings page that may need to be accessed through Admin > Authentication Systems rather than the modern Persona Bar interface.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Evoq Persona Bar open with no error messages or crashes visible. The UI is functioning normally - the test simply couldn't find the Role Synchronization settings in the Persona Bar's Security area. This is a test environment limitation (no AD server) combined with looking in the wrong location for legacy authentication provider settings.",

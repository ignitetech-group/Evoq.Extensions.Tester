  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The screenshot evidence contradicts the test report. The 'save error' screenshot shows a completely unrelated Community page with a Copilot welcome dialog, not the claimed 'critical error' page with NullReferenceException. Without visual confirmation of the error, the test report cannot be verified.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 correctly shows module settings with Photo Attachments disabled and File Attachments enabled. Screenshot 2 does NOT show any error - instead it displays a Community settings page with an Influence goals table and a 'Welcome to Copilot!' popup, completely unrelated to the module settings save operation.",

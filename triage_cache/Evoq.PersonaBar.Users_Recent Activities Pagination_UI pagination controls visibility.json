  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test could not be completed because it required a user with >10 activities that wasn't the logged-in SuperUser. The API pagination was confirmed working correctly; the only limitation was that the SuperUser cannot view their own activity (which is by design). This is a test precondition issue, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Users panel with Content Editor user expanded, displaying Recent Activity section working correctly with 1 activity. Test observations confirm API pagination works (page size 10, correct page counts, proper last-page behavior). SuperUser has 135 activities but cannot view own activity through Users panel - this appears to be intentional design, not a defect.",

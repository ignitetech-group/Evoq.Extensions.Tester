  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The workflow setting UI exists, the user can select Content Approval, the save operation appears to complete successfully (Save button grays out), but the setting does not persist when the page is reloaded. This is a clear data persistence failure where the save silently fails to actually save the workflow configuration.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show: (1) Initial state with Workflow: Off, (2) Content Approval selected in dropdown with unsaved changes indicator, (3) Post-save state with Content Approval still showing and Save button disabled, (4) After page reload, Workflow reverted to Off. The save operation completes visually but the data is not persisted to the database.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The HTTP 401.2 error is an IIS server configuration issue, not a bug in the AD Authentication extension. Windows Authentication must be explicitly enabled in IIS as a precondition - the extension correctly attempts to use Windows auth but IIS is not configured to support it. This is a test environment setup requirement, not an application defect.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows standard IIS HTTP 401.2 error page indicating 'No authentication protocol (including anonymous) is selected in IIS.' The error occurs when accessing WindowsSignin.aspx, which requires IIS-level Windows Authentication to be enabled - a server configuration step outside the application's control.",

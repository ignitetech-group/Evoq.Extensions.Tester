  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test is checking RequireJS path configuration internals for a stub/placeholder module that has no real functionality (empty init/load functions, 'Hello World' text, empty controllers). This is testing implementation details rather than user-facing behavior.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Evoq CMS PersonaBar interface with no visible error messages to users. The test found a 404 in console due to path mismatch, but the module itself is documented as a minimal stub with empty functions and placeholder content. No user-facing functionality is actually broken since there is no real functionality implemented yet.",

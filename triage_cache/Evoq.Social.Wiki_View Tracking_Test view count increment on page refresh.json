  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires published articles to verify view count increment, but articles were in draft state. The SQL stored procedure Wiki_Article_UpdateViewCount correctly only increments counts for published articles (State = 2), which is by design, not a bug. The test preconditions were not met.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows an empty wiki page with no article content rendered. The test documentation confirms articles are in draft state, and code review shows view count tracking is correctly implemented but only activates for published articles. No error messages, crashes, or broken UI elements are visible - the feature simply requires published content to function.",

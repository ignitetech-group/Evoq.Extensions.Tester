  "reasoning": "The article detail page is empty because no Wiki Article module was configured on the page to display content and comments. This is a test environment setup/configuration issue, not a bug in the application. The comments functionality exists in the code but the page needs proper module configuration.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Wiki Test article detail page with a completely empty content area - no article content, no comments section. Only the trial version banner is visible. The page structure exists but no Wiki Article module has been added to display article details and enable comments functionality.",

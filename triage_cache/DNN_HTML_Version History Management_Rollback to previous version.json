  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test created its own conflict by performing a publish action and then immediately attempting a restore without refreshing. The 'state changed' error is a concurrency safety feature working correctly, not a bug - the test blamed the application for blocking actions that conflicted with its own prior actions.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Page History with 2 published versions and a modal stating 'Another user has taken action on the page and its state has been changed.' This concurrency protection triggered because the test's own previous publish action modified the page state before attempting the restore, creating a self-inflicted conflict.",
  "scenario_id": "DNN_HTML::Version History Management::Rollback to previous version",

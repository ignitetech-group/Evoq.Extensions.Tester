  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking for 'change primary article' functionality without first establishing a primary article. You cannot change a primary article to a different one when no primary article exists - this is a test precondition failure, not an application bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows wiki module with 'Create article for front page...' prompt indicating no primary article exists yet. The UI is functioning correctly with 6 articles visible, no errors displayed, and all controls responsive. The test failed due to unmet preconditions (no existing primary article to change), not due to any application defect.",

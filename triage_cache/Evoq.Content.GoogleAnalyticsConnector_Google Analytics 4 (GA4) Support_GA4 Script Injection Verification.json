  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected direct gtag.js script injection into page HTML, but DNN/Evoq uses its own centralized analytics service (qa.dnnapi.com/analytics/js/) to handle tracking. The connector correctly saves the Measurement ID which is passed to DNN's service - this is by design, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Site Settings admin panel. Test observations confirm DNN uses its own analytics API service rather than direct gtag.js injection. The connector accepts and stores the GA4 Measurement ID correctly; the difference is in implementation architecture, not functionality.",

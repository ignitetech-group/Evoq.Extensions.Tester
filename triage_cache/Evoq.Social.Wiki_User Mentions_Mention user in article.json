  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failure is due to the tester being unable to find/navigate to a properly configured Wiki page with the full article editor. The screenshots show no errors - just blank content areas indicating module configuration or navigation issues, not a bug in the User Mentions feature itself.",
  "evidence_summary": "Both screenshots show Evoq CMS loading normally with header, navigation, and footer intact. The content areas are blank but show no 404 errors, JavaScript errors, or crash dialogs as claimed. The tester confirmed the backend User Mentions code exists but couldn't access a properly configured editor to test it - this is a test setup/precondition issue, not an application bug.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected a UI checkbox that is intentionally hidden (visible='False') and marked as 'reserved for future implementation'. The underlying password synchronization security feature works automatically without user configuration - this is by design, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show the AD extension is properly installed (v10.1.1) and the Security settings panel is functional. The 'Synchronize Password' checkbox exists in code but is deliberately hidden for future use. Password randomization is automatic and unconditional, so the security requirement is met without exposing this setting to users.",

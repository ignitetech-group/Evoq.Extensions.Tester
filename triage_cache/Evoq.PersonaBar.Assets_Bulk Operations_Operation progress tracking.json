  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was looking for progress tracking UI during bulk operations, but bulk operations were never implemented in this extension. The screenshot shows a normally-functioning Assets panel with single-item operations only (Edit, Move, Copy, Download, Delete icons appear on hover for individual files). There are no multi-select checkboxes, no bulk action toolbar, and no progress indicators because the feature simply doesn't exist - this is not a bug, it's testing for unimplemented functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Assets panel with folders and files displayed in a grid view. When an item is selected (cavalier-logo.png), single-item action icons appear on the right side. There are no checkboxes for multi-select, no 'Select All' option, no bulk operation toolbar, and no error messages. The UI is functioning correctly for its single-item operation design. Code review confirmed only single-item API endpoints exist in AssetsController.cs and no multi-select state management in Assets.js.",

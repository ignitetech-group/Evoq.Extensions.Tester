  "reasoning": "The test was unable to verify role-based permissions because it couldn't log in as different users with varying permission levels. Testing as host user and seeing all workflow options is expected behavior, not a bug. The code analysis confirms permissions ARE properly implemented.",
  "evidence_summary": "Test attempted to verify role-based workflow permissions but could only test as host user due to UI navigation issues. Code confirms WorkflowSecurity.HasStateReviewerPermission and IsReviewer property are properly implemented. No actual error occurred - the test simply couldn't set up the required preconditions (multiple users with different roles).",

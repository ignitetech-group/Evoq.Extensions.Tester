  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The screenshots clearly show Comments Page Size was set to '50 Items' and saved with success feedback, but after page refresh it reverted to '5 Items' (default). This is a data persistence failure where the save operation reports success but doesn't actually persist the value to the database.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows Comments Page Size dropdown set to '50 Items' before save. Screenshot 2 shows the same setting reverted to '5 Items' after page refresh. The UI provides a working save button with success feedback, but the CommentsPageSize value does not persist - a clear backend/database persistence bug.",

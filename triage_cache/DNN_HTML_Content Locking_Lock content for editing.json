  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test found localization resource strings for Lock/Unlock actions in the code and assumed the feature should exist, but those strings are placeholders for a planned feature that was never implemented. The TODO comment confirms this was planned but not built. This is checking implementation details (resource strings) rather than actual user-facing functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows edit mode enabled successfully. Screenshot 2 shows the Module Actions menu containing Settings, Export Content, Import Content, Help, Develop, Delete, and Refresh - no Lock Content option exists. The test expected Lock Content based on finding unused localization strings in source code, but the feature was never actually implemented.",

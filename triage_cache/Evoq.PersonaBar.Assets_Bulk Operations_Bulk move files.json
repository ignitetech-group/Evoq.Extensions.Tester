  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected bulk move functionality that was never implemented in the Assets extension. This is not a broken feature but rather planned functionality that doesn't exist - no multi-select UI, no bulk API endpoints, and no errors are present.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows standard Assets panel with single-item hover actions (Edit, Move, Copy, Download, Delete) for individual files. No multi-select checkboxes, bulk action toolbar, or selection mode exists. The application is functioning correctly with single-item operations; the bulk operations feature was simply never built.",

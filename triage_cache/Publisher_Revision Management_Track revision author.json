  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed that because revision author tracking properties exist in the backend code (Revision.cs entity), there should be a corresponding UI to display this information. However, having backend data properties does not mean there must be a UI exposing them - these are internal tracking fields. The test was checking implementation details rather than user-facing behavior.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a functioning Edit Mode interface with no errors. The test found revision tracking properties in code (CreatedUserId, LastModifiedUserId) but no 'Revision History' UI panel. This is not a bug - the backend has the data for internal purposes, but no UI was built to expose revision author information to users. No error messages, crashes, or broken functionality observed.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test found backend code (RevisionController.Compare) and assumed it should have a corresponding UI, but the screenshot shows no revision history UI exists in the Post Editor. This appears to be internal/backend functionality that was never exposed to users, not a broken feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows standard page edit mode with content blocks, Discard/Publish buttons, and edit toolbar. No 'Revision History' button or revision comparison UI is visible anywhere in the interface. The test incorrectly assumed backend revision code should have a user-facing interface.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was looking for a 'Migration Tool' UI that never existed - Content Layout Migration is an automatic background upgrade process triggered through IUpgradeable.UpgradeModule(), not a user-facing feature. The feature description's UI Location was simply incorrect.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a fully functional Evoq CMS with no errors. The Settings menu, Site Behavior tabs, and Scheduler all work correctly but contain no Migration Tool because it was never designed as a UI feature - it's an automatic database migration that runs during module upgrade from legacy ContentLayouts table to the new architecture.",

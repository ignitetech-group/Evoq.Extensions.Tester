  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking internal implementation details (resource file strings vs manifest keys) rather than user-facing behavior. The screenshot shows a fully functional Workflows panel with no visible localization errors - no raw resource keys like 'nav_Accounts' are displayed in the UI.",
  "evidence_summary": "The screenshot shows the Evoq PersonaBar Workflows panel working correctly with proper UI text ('Workflows', 'Direct Publish', 'Save Draft', etc.). The left navigation sidebar displays icons, not broken text. There is no evidence of the alleged 'nav_Accounts' string appearing anywhere in the visible UI. The test analyzed internal .resx and .dnn files for key mismatches rather than observing actual UI failures.",
  "scenario_id": "Evoq.PersonaBar.AccountSettings::Module Resources and Localization::Test nav_AccountSettings.Text resource returns 'Accounts'",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected bulk operations/multi-select functionality that was never implemented in this extension. Code review confirmed no batch endpoints exist in the backend and no multi-select state management exists in the frontend. The UI is functioning correctly - it simply doesn't include this feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a fully functional Assets panel with single-item operations (Edit, Move, Copy, Download, Delete) that work correctly on hover. No checkboxes, multi-select toggle, or select-all buttons exist anywhere in the UI. There are no error messages, crashes, or broken functionality - the test was simply looking for features that were never built.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test looked for @ mention autocomplete in the quick create article dialog, which intentionally uses a simple textarea by design. The @ mention feature requires the full Redactor-based article editor (ContentEditor.ascx) available on article detail pages, not the simplified quick create modal. The tester navigated to the wrong location to test this feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots clearly show the 'Create an article' quick dialog uses a plain HTML textarea, not a Redactor rich text editor. The @ mention functionality with autocomplete requires the full article editor with Redactor initialization, which is only available when editing an existing article on its detail page. No errors or crashes occurred - the feature simply doesn't exist in this location by design.",

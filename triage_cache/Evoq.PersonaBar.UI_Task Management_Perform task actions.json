  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The Tasks UI is intentionally hidden per internal ticket CONTENT-8436 with explicit code '$tasks.hide(); return;' in evoq.js. The test attempted to test a feature that is deliberately disabled by design, not broken.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows PersonaBar with Settings panel open but no Tasks UI visible. The test observations confirm this is intentional - the Tasks panel was hidden per ticket CONTENT-8436, with the filter feature also commented out as 'leave it to next release'. The backend API still functions but the UI was purposely removed from view.",

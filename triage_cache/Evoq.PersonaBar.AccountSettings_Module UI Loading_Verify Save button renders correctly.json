  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking implementation details (CSS class 'primarybtn') on a placeholder/stub module that is explicitly documented as having minimal functionality with empty init/load functions and no business logic. This is not a bug - it's testing an incomplete placeholder extension as if it were a finished feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows PersonaBar with no AccountSettings panel loaded. Test observations confirm the module is a stub with 'Hello World' content, empty JavaScript functions, and empty C# controllers - indicating this is intentionally a placeholder, not a broken production feature.",

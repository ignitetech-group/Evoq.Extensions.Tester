  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The screenshot clearly shows an actual server error message 'Value cannot be null. Parameter name: folder' displayed in the UI when attempting to upload a file to a workflow-enabled folder. This is a genuine backend bug where the folder parameter is not being correctly passed to the upload handler.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show successful navigation to TestFolder01 and opening of the upload dialog. When a file (workflow_test_file.txt) was uploaded, the UI displayed a red error message indicating a null parameter exception for 'folder', confirming that file upload to workflow-enabled folders is broken due to a missing/null folder context in the upload request.",

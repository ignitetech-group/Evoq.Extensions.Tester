  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed due to missing preconditions - no users in the test environment had files in their personal folders. The application correctly responded with 'does not own any assets' messages, which is expected behavior when users have no files.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a properly functioning Users panel with two users listed. The test attempted to verify Assets panel opening but couldn't complete because neither test user had files uploaded. This is a test setup limitation, not an application defect.",

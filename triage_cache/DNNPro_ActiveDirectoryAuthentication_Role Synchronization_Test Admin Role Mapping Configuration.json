  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed Admin Role Mapping settings should be accessible via Persona Bar navigation because code exists in Settings.ascx, but DNN authentication provider settings controls are typically accessed through module-specific or legacy admin paths, not through Persona Bar. No actual error or malfunction is present.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a normally functioning Evoq CMS interface with Persona Bar - no errors, no crashes. The test found Settings.ascx code exists but couldn't find Persona Bar navigation to it. This reflects a misunderstanding of where DNN authentication provider settings are accessed, not a bug in the application.",

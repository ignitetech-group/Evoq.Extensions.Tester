  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because article detail pages in the test environment don't have the Wiki module configured to display article content and social features. This is a test environment setup issue, not a code bug - the like count code exists and is correct but requires the Wiki module to be placed on article detail pages.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Wiki article list view working correctly with 5 articles displayed. Test observations confirm the code for likes exists (Article.ascx, dnn.wiki.Article.js) but article detail pages lack the Wiki module configuration needed to render article content and like counts.",
  "scenario_id": "Evoq.Social.Wiki::Social - Likes::View like count",

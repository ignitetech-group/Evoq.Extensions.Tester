  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed Domain Name configuration should be accessible in the UI because it exists in the codebase (advanced.htm, connector.js), but the GA4 connector intentionally only exposes Measurement ID and Track for Administrators - the advanced settings with Domain Name is legacy Universal Analytics code not used by the current GA4 implementation.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Google Analytics 4 connector with only two fields: Measurement ID and Track for Administrators checkbox. No Domain Name field, no Advanced Settings link, and no toggle switch are present. The feature exists in code but is not user-facing functionality for GA4.",

  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The Discard functionality shows a clear error dialog after user confirms the discard action. The API call to /API/EvoqContentLibrary/Publishing/DiscardTab fails with a server error, causing a 'page state has been changed' error message. This is a real server-side bug, likely a race condition with the autosave feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows draft content with [DRAFT TEST] indicator. Screenshot 2 shows the proper Discard confirmation dialog. Screenshot 3 shows an Error dialog stating 'Another user has taken action on the page and its state has been changed' - a clear server error when attempting a valid discard operation.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because the article detail page was not configured with a Wiki Article module to display content and comments. This is a test environment setup issue - the page structure was incomplete, not a bug in the commenting functionality which code review confirms exists and works.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a completely empty article detail page with no content or comments section rendered. No error messages present. The Wiki Article module was simply not added to the article detail page template, so there's nothing to display or interact with - this is a missing page configuration, not broken functionality.",

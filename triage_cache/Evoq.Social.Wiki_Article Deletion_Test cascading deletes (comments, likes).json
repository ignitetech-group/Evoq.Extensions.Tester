  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "Testing cascading deletes (verifying comments, likes, subscriptions, journal entries, and revisions are removed) is a backend database verification task that cannot be performed through the UI. The test also lacked required preconditions (an article with associated data and proper permissions).",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows an empty Evoq page with no article loaded and no visible errors. The test was attempting to verify internal database cascading behavior which is not a UI-testable feature, and failed due to both missing preconditions and the fundamental nature of the test being backend-focused.",

  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The Evoq Google Analytics Connector is confirmed installed with fully implemented Segmentation Rules code, but a naming conflict with the GA4 connector (both using 'GoogleAnalytics' as connector name) causes the legacy connector to be hidden/overridden, making its Advanced Settings and Segmentation Rules features completely inaccessible.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Connectors page with 'Google Analytics 4' listed but no 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector' visible. Test observations confirm the legacy connector IS installed and has Segmentation Rules implemented, but the GA4 connector's identical internal name causes it to take precedence, hiding the legacy connector's UI and functionality entirely.",

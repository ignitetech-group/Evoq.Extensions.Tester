{
  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test was attempting to test Segmentation Rules functionality that belongs to the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector', but the test environment has both legacy and GA4 connectors installed with conflicting connector names, causing GA4 to override. This is a test environment configuration issue, not a bug in the connector code.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Connectors page with 'GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4' displayed instead of the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector'. The UI functions correctly - there are no errors, crashes, or broken elements. The conflict arises because both connectors share the same internal name 'GoogleAnalytics', causing GA4 to take precedence over the legacy connector that contains the Segmentation Rules feature.",

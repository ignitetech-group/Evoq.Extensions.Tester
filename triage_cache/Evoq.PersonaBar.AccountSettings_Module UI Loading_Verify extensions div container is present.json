  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking for specific implementation details (div id='tabs-extensions' and CSS class 'personabar-extensions') rather than user-facing behavior. Additionally, the module is explicitly a placeholder/stub with empty controllers and 'Hello World' text - it's not a fully implemented feature that should be expected to work.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows PersonaBar sidebar visible but no Account Settings panel loaded. Test observations confirm the module is a stub with empty init/load functions, empty CSS, 'Hello World' placeholder text, and empty C# controllers - indicating this is unfinished placeholder code, not a bug in working functionality.",

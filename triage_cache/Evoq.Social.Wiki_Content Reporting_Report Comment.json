{
  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failure is due to missing test environment configuration - the Wiki Article detail view module was never placed on article subpages, which is a prerequisite for testing the Report Comment functionality. The code is fully implemented but the test setup was incomplete.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows an empty article detail page with only a trial banner and footer - no article content or comments section rendered. The test observations confirm the Report functionality exists in code (Article.ascx line 109, ReportContent.ascx, ReportController.cs) but cannot be accessed because the Wiki module was not configured on article detail pages, making this a page template configuration issue rather than a code defect.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires valid OAuth client credentials as a precondition, which were deleted on Google's side (Error 401: deleted_client). The Evoq application code worked correctly by redirecting to Google OAuth - the failure is due to external credential misconfiguration, not an application bug. Additionally, this OAuth connector is not visible in the UI (replaced by GA4 connector), suggesting deprecated functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Google's 'Access blocked: Authorization Error' page stating 'The OAuth client was deleted' with Error 401: deleted_client. The Evoq API endpoint successfully initiated the OAuth redirect to Google, but the configured OAuth client ID no longer exists in Google's system. The OAuth-based connector is not visible in the Connectors UI, with only the GA4 Measurement ID-based connector being available.",

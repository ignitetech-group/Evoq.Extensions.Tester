  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The screenshots definitively show that saved settings do not persist to the database. The Profanity Filtering value changed from 'Prohibit Content' to 'Filter Content' after navigation, and Comment Moderation checkboxes also reverted. This is a save functionality failure where the UI shows success but data is not persisted.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 2 shows 'Prohibit Content' selected with all Comment Moderation checkboxes checked. Screenshot 4 (after navigation and return) shows 'Filter Content' with all Comment Moderation checkboxes unchecked - clear evidence that the save operation did not persist to the database despite showing a success message.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires community content data to exist as a precondition for verifying view counts. The application correctly displays an empty state message ('No popular content available in selected period') when no content is present - this is proper UI behavior, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Community Analytics dashboard functioning correctly with Creates: 0, Views: 0, and appropriate empty state messages for both Trending Tags and Popular Content sections. No errors visible, UI rendering properly - just no test data available to verify view counts against.",

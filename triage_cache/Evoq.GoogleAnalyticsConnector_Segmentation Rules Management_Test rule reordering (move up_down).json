  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking for Segmentation Rules functionality that exists in the 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector' extension, but a separate 'Google Analytics 4' connector using the same internal name is overriding it. This is an extension conflict/configuration issue where the required precondition (legacy connector being active) is not met, not a bug in the code being tested.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Connectors settings page with 'GOOGLE ANALYTICS 4' listed but not the legacy 'Evoq Google Analytics Connector'. The GA4 connector lacks Advanced Settings/Segmentation Rules UI. Both connectors share the 'GoogleAnalytics' name, causing GA4 to take precedence and hide the legacy connector's features.",

  "reasoning": "The test is checking for 'Hello World, This is Site Settings.' placeholder text in a stub module that has empty controllers, empty JS functions, and empty CSS. This is a development placeholder/template, not actual user-facing functionality. Testing for placeholder text in a stub module is checking implementation details rather than real behavior.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the standard Site Settings panel open with Site Info tab displaying form fields. The test was looking for AccountSettings panel which, according to observations, is a placeholder module with empty controllers, empty JS init/load functions, and 'Hello World' placeholder HTML text - clearly a development stub rather than a working feature.",

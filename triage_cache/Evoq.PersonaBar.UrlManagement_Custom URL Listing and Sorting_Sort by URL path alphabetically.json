  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed column headers should be clickable for sorting based on backend code that supports sorting, but the UI was never designed to expose sorting controls through clickable column headers. This is a feature that doesn't exist in the user interface, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a URL list table with static column headers (URL, URL TYPE, GENERATED BY) that have no visual indicators of being clickable sort controls. The UI displays URLs correctly but does not implement client-side sorting via column headers - this is by design, not a defect.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test attempted to delete a draft article without proper preconditions - no draft article appears to exist. The empty page shows no error, just missing content, indicating the test setup failed to create the required draft article before testing deletion functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows an empty wiki content area with no article rendered. The page loads correctly with no errors visible. The navigation and UI framework are functional, but no article content exists to test deletion on - this is a missing precondition rather than a rendering bug.",

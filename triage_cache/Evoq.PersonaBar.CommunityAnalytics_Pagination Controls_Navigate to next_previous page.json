  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires community activity data to generate paginated results, but the test environment has zero content. The pagination controls correctly hide themselves when totalResults === 0 - this is working as designed, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Community Analytics page with all zeroes for Creates/Views and messages indicating no trending tags or popular content available. No pagination controls are visible because there is no data to paginate - this is correct behavior per the pagerVisible binding that hides controls when totalResults is 0.",

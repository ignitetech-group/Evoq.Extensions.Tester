  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test searched for revision timestamp UI while in the general page editor mode, not the Post Editor context where revision history is specified to exist. The backend revision tracking functionality is confirmed working; the test simply failed to navigate to the correct location.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows page editor mode with 'Posts cannot be created or edited while the page is in edit mode' message. The test was looking in the wrong UI context - revision history belongs in Post Editor, not the page editing interface. No actual errors or broken functionality observed.",

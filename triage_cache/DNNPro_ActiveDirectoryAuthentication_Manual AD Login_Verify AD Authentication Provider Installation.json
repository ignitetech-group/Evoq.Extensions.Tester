  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed Active Directory Authentication would be available because source code exists in the codebase, but the extension was never actually installed on this Evoq instance. This is a test setup/precondition issue - you cannot test AD login functionality without first installing the AD Authentication extension.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots confirm the Evoq instance has only DNN default authentication installed. The Security settings show only 'DNN' provider available, Installed Extensions shows only 'Default Authentication', and Available Extensions lists Facebook/Google/Live/Twitter but NOT Active Directory. The AD extension simply isn't deployed to this environment.",

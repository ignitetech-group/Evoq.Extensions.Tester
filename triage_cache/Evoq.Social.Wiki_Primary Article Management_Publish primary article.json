  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The Publish button appears clickable and validation passes (error clears after blur), but clicking Publish does not trigger any API call and the dialog remains open. This is a functional button that fails to execute its action - a clear UI bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a Create article dialog with content properly entered. After clicking Publish, the validation error clears (proving content is recognized), but the dialog stays open with no network activity. The Publish button's click handler is not executing the publish action despite validation passing.",

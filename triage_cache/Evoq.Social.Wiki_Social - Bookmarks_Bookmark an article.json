  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed due to incomplete test environment setup - the Wiki module was not configured on article detail pages. The bookmark functionality exists in code and works (as evidenced by article creation succeeding), but the test environment lacks proper page configuration for child pages to render the Wiki module.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show: (1) blank Wiki page in view mode, (2) edit mode shows module placeholders, (3) article creation dialog works perfectly, (4) article detail page is completely blank with no errors, (5) articles list works with multiple articles visible. The issue is missing module configuration on child pages, not a code bug - no error messages, crashes, or broken UI elements are present.",

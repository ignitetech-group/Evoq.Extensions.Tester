  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking for internal cookies (DNNReturnTo, authentication status) that only exist when Windows Authentication is enabled and an SSO flow is in progress. This requires specific environment preconditions (IIS Windows Auth, AD configuration) that weren't established - the module is correctly deployed and configured, it simply isn't activated.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a normal Security settings page with no errors. The test confirmed the AD module files ARE deployed, WindowsSignin.aspx returns expected 401.2 status, and all components exist. The cookies being tested are implementation details that only appear during an active Windows SSO authentication flow, which requires infrastructure configuration beyond the test setup.",

{
  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was looking for a deprecated 'My Work' feature based on outdated documentation. The feature has been removed from the module actions menu and workflow task management has been consolidated into the Content Library with Status filtering. No error or malfunction exists - the application is working as designed in its current version.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 2 clearly shows the module actions menu with Settings, Export Content, Import Content, Help, Develop, Delete, and Refresh options - no 'My Work' option. The test observations confirm the MyWork.ascx file was not found in the codebase and direct URL access shows an empty page, indicating the feature has been deprecated rather than broken.",

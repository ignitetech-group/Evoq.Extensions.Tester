  "reasoning": "The Name field is marked as required with an asterisk (*) but the system allowed creating a page without a name (Page ID: 63). This is a clear validation failure where client-side and server-side validation are not properly enforcing the required field constraint.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows the empty Name* field during page creation. Screenshot 3 confirms a page with no name was created and now exists in the page tree (visible as a blank entry with just a page icon below 'Test Page Two'), with Page ID 63 shown in the details panel and the Name field still empty.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test found backend code for revision management and incorrectly assumed it should have a user-facing UI. The presence of RevisionController.Rollback() in the codebase does not mean users are meant to access it directly - this is likely an internal/administrative feature or requires specific permissions/configuration to appear.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a normal post editor with image upload dialog, functioning without errors. No 'Revision History' UI exists, but there are no error messages, crashes, or broken functionality - the application works correctly. The test assumed backend code implies UI exposure, which is an invalid assumption.",

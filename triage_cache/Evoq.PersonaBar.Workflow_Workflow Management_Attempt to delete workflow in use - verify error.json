  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was looking for delete workflow functionality that doesn't exist in the UI. While the delete API exists in WorkflowsController.cs, there is no UI element to trigger it - the ACTIONS column only provides actions for individual workflow states, not for deleting entire workflows. This is a case of the test assuming UI functionality should exist because the backend code supports it.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Workflow Management panel with workflow states table (Draft, Published) and action buttons for states only. No delete workflow button or mechanism is visible in the UI. The test cannot verify error handling for deleting in-use workflows because the delete action is not exposed to users through the interface.",

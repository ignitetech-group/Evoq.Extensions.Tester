  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test failed due to unmet preconditions - article detail page routing was not configured in the test environment. The 404 is a soft 'page not found' message indicating missing page/route configuration, not a code bug. Code review confirms permission functionality exists in the codebase.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a standard CMS 404 error page when attempting to access article detail pages. The Wiki module appears in navigation but article URLs are not routed. This is an environment configuration issue preventing test execution, not a defect in the permission checking functionality which code review confirms is implemented.",

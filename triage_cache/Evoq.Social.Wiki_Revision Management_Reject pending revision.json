  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The article detail page is empty but shows no errors - the test requires preconditions (existing Wiki articles with pending revisions) that were not set up. The empty page indicates missing test data rather than a broken feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Wiki Test page loaded successfully with no JavaScript or server errors, but the content area is completely blank. The page frame, navigation, and trial banner all render correctly. The revision reject feature requires an existing article with a pending revision as a precondition, which was not established before attempting to test the rejection workflow.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected clickable column header sorting, but the UI was never designed with sortable columns - the headers are static labels without any sort controls or visual indicators. While the backend API supports sorting, this feature is not exposed through the Page Settings UI.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a URL listing table where column headers (URL, URL TYPE, GENERATED BY) are plain text labels with no sort indicators, hover states, or clickable behavior. The test failed because it assumed column headers would be interactive sorting controls, but they are static display labels by design.",

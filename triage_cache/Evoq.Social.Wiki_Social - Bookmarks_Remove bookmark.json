  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The article detail page fails to render any content - only header and footer are displayed. This is a real rendering failure, not a test misunderstanding. The blank page prevents access to both article content and bookmark functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows article detail page with completely empty content area - only site navigation, trial banner, and footer visible. No article body, no bookmark buttons, no Wiki module content renders at all, despite the page loading without errors.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was looking for bulk copy functionality that was never implemented in the Assets extension. The screenshot and code review confirm only single-item operations exist (hover menu with Edit, Move, Copy, Download, Delete per item). There are no errors or broken functionality - the feature simply doesn't exist.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows Assets panel with folders and files in grid view. Hovering over 'cavalier-logo.png' reveals single-item action icons (Edit, Move, Copy, Download, Delete). No multi-select checkboxes, no bulk action toolbar, no 'Select All' option exists. The UI operates exactly as designed for single-item operations only.",

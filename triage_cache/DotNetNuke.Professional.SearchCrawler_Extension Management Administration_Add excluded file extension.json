  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The validation error is intentional security behavior - extensions must be in the Host.AllowedExtensionWhitelist before they can be added. This is a security feature working as designed, not a bug. Additionally, 'zip' already exists in the excluded list, so the test was redundant.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the File Extension form with 'zip' entered and a red validation error icon. The UI is functioning correctly - it's enforcing the host whitelist security validation. Existing excluded extensions (.css, .eot, .htmtemplate) are visible, confirming the feature works for pre-approved extensions.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed date ranges should persist across tabs, but the observations confirm each social module tab is designed to maintain its own independent period/date selection with settings saved 'within each module's context' to persistent storage. This is by design, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows Answers tab with date range '1 Jan 2026 - 8 Feb 2026'. Screenshot 2 shows Blogs tab with its own independent date range '2 Feb 2026 - 8 Feb 2026' and comparative term '1 w'. Both tabs function correctly with their own independent settings - there are no errors, crashes, or broken UI elements. The test incorrectly expected shared state across tabs when the architecture deliberately uses separate per-module storage.",

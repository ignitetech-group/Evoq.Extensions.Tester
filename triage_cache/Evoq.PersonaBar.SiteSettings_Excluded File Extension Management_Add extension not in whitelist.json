  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test attempted to add an extension (.tmp) that is not in the host's allowed whitelist. The server correctly rejected this per the system's design - you can only exclude extensions that are already in the allowed list. This is expected validation behavior, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the excluded file extensions form with '.tmp' entered. The test observations confirm this is 'by design' behavior - the excluded list only accepts extensions from the host whitelist. The UI is functioning correctly; the rejection is intentional server-side validation.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failure is due to incomplete test setup - the article detail page was never configured with Wiki modules. This is a precondition failure, not a bug in the metadata editing functionality which exists in the codebase (MetaDataController.cs, MetaDataEditor.ascx) but simply wasn't accessible because the test page lacked proper module configuration.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows an empty page with no Wiki modules configured. The page displays only a trial notice banner and a Wiki privilege notification popup, but the main content area is blank with no article or metadata editing UI. The test observations confirm article detail pages do not have Wiki modules configured, which is a setup issue rather than a functional bug.",

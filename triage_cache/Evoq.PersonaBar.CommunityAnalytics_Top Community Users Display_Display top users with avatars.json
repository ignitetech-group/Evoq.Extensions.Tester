  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed the Top Community Users feature should be visible in the UI because backend code exists, but the HTML templates never include this component. This is unreleased/dead code, not a bug - the feature was either intentionally removed from UI or never completed for release.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show a fully functional Community Analytics dashboard with Community Health, Engagement, and Creates & Views sections. No error messages, no broken elements, no crashes. The test was checking for a feature that exists only in unused JavaScript code but was never integrated into the actual HTML templates rendered to users.",

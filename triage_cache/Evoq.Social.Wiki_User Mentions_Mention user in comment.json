  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because preconditions were not met - no articles exist to navigate to, and without articles there is no comments section to test @ mentions in. The feature requires an existing article's detail page with a comments section, not the article creation dialog.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show an empty Wiki with 0 articles and an article creation dialog with a plain textarea. No errors are visible. The test could not reach the comments section because no articles exist to view, making it impossible to test comment @ mention functionality.",

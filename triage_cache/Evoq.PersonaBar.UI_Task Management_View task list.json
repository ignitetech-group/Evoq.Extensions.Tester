  "reasoning": "The Tasks UI is intentionally hidden in the codebase per ticket CONTENT-8436 with explicit code '$tasks.hide(); return;'. This is a deliberate design decision, not a bug - the test assumed UI should exist for a feature that was purposely disabled.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows PersonaBar Settings menu with no Tasks option visible. Test documentation confirms code in evoq.js lines 100-102 explicitly hides the tasks panel, the backend API works at /API/personaBar/tasks/gettasks, and the filter feature is commented out with 'leave it to next release'. The feature was intentionally disabled, not broken.",

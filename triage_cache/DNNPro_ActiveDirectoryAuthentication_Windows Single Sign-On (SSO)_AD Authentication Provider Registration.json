  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumes that file deployment equals extension registration, but DNN requires extensions to be explicitly installed/registered through the platform. The files exist on disk but the extension was never properly installed - this is an incomplete test setup/precondition issue, not a bug in the extension itself.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots confirm only 'Default Authentication' is registered as an authentication system and only 'DNN' appears in the authentication provider dropdown. The test notes files ARE deployed to the filesystem but the provider is not registered - this indicates the extension was file-deployed but never properly installed through DNN's extension installation process.",

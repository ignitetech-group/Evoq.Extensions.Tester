{
  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because the article detail page does not have the Wiki module configured to display article content and social actions. The Like/Unlike functionality exists in code and is not broken - the test environment simply lacks proper page configuration where the Wiki module would render the article view with social buttons.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows an empty article detail page with only the trial warning banner and footer visible. The Wiki module is not present on this page template, so no article content or Like/Unlike buttons are rendered. This is a site configuration/test setup issue, not a bug in the Unlike functionality itself.",

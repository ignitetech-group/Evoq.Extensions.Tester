  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires preconditions that weren't met - to test 'Restore previous revision' functionality, an article with existing revisions must first exist. The empty page shows no error, just an empty module area indicating no wiki content was set up prior to testing the revision rollback feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a properly functioning Evoq CMS page with WIKI TEST navigation visible, but the main content area is empty/blank with no error messages. The page loads correctly with navigation, user account, and trial notice displayed. This indicates the Wiki module exists but has no article content to display, rather than a broken feature. The rollback functionality confirmed to exist in code (RevisionsApiController.cs) simply cannot be accessed without first creating articles and generating revision history.",

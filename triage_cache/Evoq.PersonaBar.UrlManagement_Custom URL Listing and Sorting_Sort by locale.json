  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test expected to sort by locale based on backend API capabilities (SortingFields.Locale), but the UI was never designed to expose a Locale column or sorting controls. This is a backend-only feature that the test incorrectly assumed should be user-facing.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows URL list table with only URL, URL TYPE, and GENERATED BY columns - no Locale column exists. Column headers are plain text labels without sorting controls. The backend supports locale sorting but the UI intentionally does not expose this feature to users.",

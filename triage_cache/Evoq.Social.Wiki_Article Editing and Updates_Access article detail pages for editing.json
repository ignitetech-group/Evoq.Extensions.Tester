  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The screenshots show actual 404 error pages and empty content areas when attempting to access wiki articles. These are real application errors visible in the UI - the Wiki module's URL routing is broken, preventing access to article detail pages that should exist based on the code review confirming CRUD operations in ArticleController.cs.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 displays a genuine 404 error page when clicking article links. Screenshot 2 shows the Wiki page rendering completely empty with no article content. Both indicate the Wiki module's URL routing is not configured properly, which is a real bug that blocks all article editing functionality.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The Top Community Users feature requires actual community engagement data (spectators, active users, power rankings) to display. Without this data present in the test environment, the UI section not rendering is expected behavior, not a bug. The test setup lacked the necessary preconditions.",
  "evidence_summary": "Test could not find the Top Community Users section because the feature conditionally renders only when community engagement data exists. The presence of a 'NoDataAvailable' resource string confirms this is by design. No actual errors occurred - the component simply had no data to display.",

  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test failed because the Content Managers role has 0 users assigned, which is a test setup/precondition issue, not a bug. The Roles page displays correctly, showing roles are properly configured but simply have no test users assigned to enable role-specific testing.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Roles management page functioning correctly with Content Managers role existing but having 0 users. The application is working properly - the roles infrastructure is in place, but the test environment lacks users assigned to the Content Manager role needed to verify role-specific access control behavior.",

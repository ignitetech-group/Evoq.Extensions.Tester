  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was looking for a filter dropdown in a Tasks UI that was intentionally hidden per ticket CONTENT-8436 and never implemented (code commented out with 'leave it to next release'). This is a deliberate product decision to defer the feature, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows PersonaBar with no Tasks UI visible. Test documentation confirms the Tasks panel is intentionally hidden via code ($tasks.hide()) per ticket CONTENT-8436, and the filter feature was never implemented - it exists only as commented-out code marked for a future release.",

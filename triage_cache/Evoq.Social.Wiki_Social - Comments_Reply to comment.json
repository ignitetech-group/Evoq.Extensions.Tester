  "reasoning": "The article detail page is empty because no Wiki Article module was configured on the page to display content and comments. This is a test environment setup/configuration issue, not a bug in the comments functionality.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a completely empty article detail page with only the header, navigation, and trial warning message. The observations confirm that 'article detail pages have no Wiki Article module configured to display content and comments' - the comments code exists and works, but the test page was not properly configured with the required module.",

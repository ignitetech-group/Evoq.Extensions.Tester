  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires the AD Authentication provider to be installed as a precondition, but it was not installed on the test environment. This is a missing test setup requirement, not a bug in the application - the standard login form works correctly.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the standard DNN login page functioning normally with Username/Password fields, but no AD authentication tab exists because the AD provider extension is not installed on this test instance.",

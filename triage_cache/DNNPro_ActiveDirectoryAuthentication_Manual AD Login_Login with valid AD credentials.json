  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires the AD Authentication provider to be installed and configured as a precondition, but it was not. This is a test environment setup issue, not a bug - the application is working correctly with only the default authentication provider enabled.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a standard DNN login page functioning normally with Username/Password fields and Login button. No AD authentication tab exists because the AD provider is not installed on this test instance. The code exists in the codebase but was never deployed/enabled in the test environment.",

{
  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The failure is due to network restrictions in the test environment preventing DNS resolution of external URLs, not a bug in the application. The UploadFromUrl feature is working correctly - it properly attempts to fetch the URL and displays an appropriate error when the server cannot resolve external hostnames.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot 1 shows the From URL interface is functional with URL input field and Upload button properly displayed. Screenshot 2 shows a clear error dialog stating 'The remote name could not be resolved: via.placeholder.com' which is a DNS/network configuration issue in the test environment, not an application defect. The feature code exists and the UI works; only external network access is blocked.",

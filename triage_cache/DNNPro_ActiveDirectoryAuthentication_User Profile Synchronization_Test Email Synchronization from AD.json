  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires Active Directory infrastructure and Windows Authentication configured in IIS, which are external environmental prerequisites not set up in the test environment. The 401.2 error is expected behavior when Windows Authentication is not configured on the IIS server - this is an infrastructure configuration issue, not an application bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows HTTP Error 401.2 - Unauthorized from IIS Web Core with error code 0x80070005, indicating Windows Authentication is not configured on the server. The test attempted to access WindowsSignin.aspx but IIS lacks the required authentication protocol setup. The extension is installed but not enabled, and AD authentication infrastructure was never configured as a test precondition.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was looking for Import/Export Content functionality that was never implemented in the Wiki module. Code review confirms the module lacks the IPortable interface required for DNN module-level import/export, and the manifest explicitly excludes the 'Portable' feature.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show all menus working correctly with no errors. Admin menu displays Settings/Help/Develop/Delete/Refresh options. Edit menu displays 'Add Companion Modules'. The absence of Import/Export Content is not a bug - it's an unimplemented feature, as confirmed by the module's BusinessController.cs not implementing IPortable and Wiki.dnn manifest excluding 'Portable' from supportedFeatures.",

  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test requires that the AD Authentication provider be registered and enabled in DNN's authentication settings as a precondition, but this configuration step was never performed. The module files are deployed but the provider is not activated - this is expected behavior, not a bug.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a standard DNN login page with username/password fields but no Windows/AD authentication tab. The test observations confirm module files are deployed and WindowsSignin.aspx exists and is configured correctly, but the provider is simply not registered as an active authentication system - a required administrative configuration step that was not performed during test setup.",

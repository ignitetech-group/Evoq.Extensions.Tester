  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test assumed that because a PersonaBarApiController class exists in the codebase, it should respond to API requests. However, the controller is intentionally empty with no action methods - this is a placeholder/stub, not broken functionality. There is no user-facing feature that relies on this empty controller.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows standard IIS 404 with Handler: StaticFile, confirming no Web API route exists. The controller code has proper attributes but no action methods defined - it's an empty shell. The PersonaBar menu config shows empty controller/path fields, indicating this module's functionality may not require or use direct API endpoints.",

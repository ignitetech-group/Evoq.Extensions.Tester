  "classification": "LEGITIMATE_BUG",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The wiki article detail pages show completely empty content areas in both view and edit modes. When a user navigates to view a wiki article, the article content should be displayed, but instead only the site header, trial message, and footer are visible. This is a clear rendering failure of the Wiki module that would prevent users from viewing or editing any wiki content.",
  "evidence_summary": "Both screenshots show the Evoq CMS interface with navigation bar, trial message banner, and footer rendering correctly, but the main content area where the wiki article should appear is completely blank. The page template loads but the Wiki module fails to render any content. This is consistent across both view mode (step09) and edit mode (step10), confirming a systematic module rendering failure rather than a test navigation error.",

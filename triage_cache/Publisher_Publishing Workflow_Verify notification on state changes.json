  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test could not verify notifications because it requires checking the DNN core notification panel or email delivery system, which was not part of the test infrastructure. The Publisher extension correctly passes Message/UserComment to the DNN WorkflowEngine, but notification delivery is handled by DNN core, not the Publisher extension itself.",
  "evidence_summary": "Test acknowledges 'notification delivery could not be verified' and notes that notification system depends on DNN core WorkflowEngine. The code correctly supports StateTransactionMessage with Params and UserComment, but verifying actual notification delivery requires checking the notification panel or email system, which the test did not do. This is a test infrastructure limitation, not an application bug.",

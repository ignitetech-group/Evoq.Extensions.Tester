  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The test expected input format validation that was never implemented in the system. The codebase observations confirm 'no input validation exists for tracking ID format beyond non-empty check' - this is a missing feature, not broken functionality. The save operation works correctly; there are no errors, crashes, or broken UI elements.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows the Google Analytics 4 connector settings panel with 'INVALID-123456' entered in the Measurement ID field. The connector shows as connected (green checkmark) with no error messages displayed. The system accepted and saved the value without validation - functioning as designed, just lacking format validation feature.",

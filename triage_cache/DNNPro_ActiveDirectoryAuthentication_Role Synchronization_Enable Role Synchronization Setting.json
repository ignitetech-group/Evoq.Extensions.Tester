  "reasoning": "The test navigated to Security > Authentication Settings looking for provider-specific settings, but did not attempt to click the edit (pencil) icon visible next to DNNPro_ActiveDirectoryAuthentication in the Installed Extensions list (Screenshot 4). DNN authentication provider settings are typically accessed through the extension's edit action, not through the Security panel which only controls the default provider selection.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshots show successful extension installation with edit icons available on installed providers. The tester went to Security > Authentication which shows only a default provider dropdown, but did not document attempting to click the edit icon on the AD authentication extension in the Extensions page where provider-specific settings would be accessed.",

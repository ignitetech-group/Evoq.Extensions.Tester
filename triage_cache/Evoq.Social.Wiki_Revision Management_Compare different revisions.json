  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "MEDIUM",
  "reasoning": "The page loads successfully without any error messages - it simply shows no Wiki module content. This indicates the test either navigated to the wrong page, or didn't properly set up the preconditions (creating an article with revisions) before attempting to access revision comparison features.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a fully functional Evoq CMS page that loaded correctly (navigation, header, sidebar, footer all render), but with a completely empty content area. No error messages, JavaScript errors, or server errors are visible. The Wiki module code exists in the codebase but isn't rendering on this page, suggesting test setup/navigation issues rather than a functional bug.",

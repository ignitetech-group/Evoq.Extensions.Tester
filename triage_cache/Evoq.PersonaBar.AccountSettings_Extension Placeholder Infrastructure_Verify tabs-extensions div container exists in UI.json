  "classification": "INVALID_TEST",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "reasoning": "The test was checking for internal infrastructure code (a div container in AccountSettings.html) that is intentionally not rendered in the UI. The empty controller and empty navigation path indicate this is a placeholder/extension point infrastructure, not user-facing functionality. The test confused code-level implementation details with expected UI elements.",
  "evidence_summary": "Screenshot shows a working PersonaBar with Workflows panel - no errors or broken functionality. The tabs-extensions div exists in code but is part of an intentionally empty infrastructure module (empty controller, empty navigation path) designed as an extension point container, not as visible UI.",
